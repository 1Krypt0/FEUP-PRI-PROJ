    "content": "WASHINGTON — SpaceX launched another set of Starlink satellites April 28, its first since the FCC approved a modification that allows the company to operate more satellites in lower orbits. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 11:44 p.m. Eastern. The rocket’s upper stage deployed its payload of 60 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit nearly 65 minutes later. The launch took place a day after  the Federal Communications Commission approved SpaceX’s request to modify its Starlink constellation . The modification will move 2,814 satellites originally approved for launch in orbits of 1,100 to 1,300 kilometers to orbits of 540 to 570 kilometers, similar to the 550-kilometer orbits used by existing Starlink satellites. SpaceX did not mention the FCC’s decision in its webcast. However, it did discuss how it chose lower orbits for spaceflight safety, ensuring that satellites will deorbit within several years of the end of their lives. It also mentioned its work with the 18th Space Control Squadron, sharing data on the orbits of Starlink satellites for collision avoidance activities, as well as  a recent agreement with NASA to coordinate maneuvers between Starlink and NASA spacecraft in low Earth orbit . “We are extremely proud of our efforts to not only provide internet access to the disconnected, but also ensure space remains a place where human spaceflight continues to grow,” Jessie Anderson, host of the webcast, said. With this launch, SpaceX has now placed 1,505 Starlink satellites into orbit, of which 1,434 remain in orbit. The company was approaching its previous authorization of 1,584 satellites in 550-kilometer orbits when the FCC approved its license modification to allow more satellites in those lower orbits. The Falcon 9’s first stage landed on a droneship in the Atlantic about eight and a half minutes after launch. The booster completed its seventh flight, which included launches of a GPS 3 satellite, the Turksat 5A communications satellite and five Starlink missions. SpaceX has been using the Starlink launches to push the limits of reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage. “There doesn’t seem to be any obvious limit to the reusability of the vehicle,” Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, said at an April 23 NASA press conference after the Crew-2 launch. “We do intend to fly the Falcon 9 booster until we some kind of a failure with the Starlink missions, have that be a life-leader.” Musk’s comments came after the first launch of a reused Falcon 9 first stage on a crewed mission. The Crew-2 launch used the same first stage that flew the Crew-1 mission the previous November. Musk said he and NASA have discussed what the optimal number of launches of a booster might be. “Do you want to be on a brand-new booster?” he asked. “You probably don’t want to be on the life leader for a crewed mission, but it’s probably good to have a flight or two under its belt.” He suggested a “couple of flights” might be best for a booster launching a crewed mission. “It’s a hard problem for a rocket,” he said of reusability. SpaceX also used the launch to honor Michael Collins, the Apollo 11 astronaut who died earlier that day at the age of 90. “Godspeed Apollo 11’s Michael Collins,” the SpaceX launch director said as the rocket lifted off. “May the pursuit of exploration live on.”",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — A SpaceX Falcon 9 launched a Turkish communications satellite Jan. 7 to start what may be the busiest year yet for the launch company. The Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 9:15 p.m. Eastern, more than 45 minutes into a four-hour launch window. SpaceX delayed the launch from the start of the window because of a problem with a ground station downrange from the launch site. The Falcon 9’s payload, the Turksat 5A communications satellite, separated from the Falcon 9’s upper stage 33 minutes after liftoff, entering into a geostationary transfer orbit. The rocket’s first stage, which previously launched the GPS SV03 satellite in June 2020 and two Starlink missions in September and October, landed on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean. Turkish satellite operator Turksat  ordered Turksat 5A and 5B from Airbus Defence and Space in 2017 , with SpaceX selected to launch the two spacecraft. Turksat 5A weighed 3,500 kilograms at launch. The spacecraft, based on the Eurostar E3000 bus, is equipped with electric propulsion for both orbit raising and station keeping. Turksat 5A will operate at 31 degrees east in GEO, providing Ku-band broadcast services over portions of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The satellite will enter service in the second quarter of 2021. Turksat 5B, weighing 4,500 kilograms, will carry Ka- and Ku-band payloads and operate from 42 degrees east in GEO. It is expected to launch later this year, also on a Falcon 9. The Turksat 5A launch is the first of the year for SpaceX, and the first orbital launch worldwide in 2021. SpaceX performed 25 orbital launches in 2020, all using Falcon 9 vehicles, while an additional Falcon 9 was launched for a suborbital in-flight abort test of the company’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. SpaceX hasn’t disclosed a specific number of launches it plans to perform in 2021, but unofficial manifests suggest the company could perform more than 30 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches in the year, for government and commercial customers as well as of its own Starlink satellites. SpaceX is also continuing work on its next-generation Starship vehicle in Boca Chica, Texas. A Starship prototype could attempt an orbital launch later this year, depending on the progress the company makes on suborbital flights of other prototypes. SpaceX’s next scheduled orbital launch is no earlier than Jan. 14, when a Falcon 9 will launch from Florida on the company’s first dedicated smallsat rideshare mission, called Transporter-1, carrying several dozen smallsats.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-siriusxm-satellite/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — A SpaceX Falcon 9 launched a new spacecraft for satellite radio company SiriusXM Dec. 13 as the company nears the end of a record-setting year. The Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 12:30 p.m. Eastern. SpaceX scrubbed a previous launch attempt two days earlier at just 30 seconds before liftoff because of a potential, but unspecified, issue with ground systems. The rocket’s upper stage deployed the SXM-7 satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit 31 minutes after liftoff. The rocket’s first stage successfully landed on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean. That stage made its seventh flight, having previously launched the Demo-1 commercial crew test flight, the Radarsat Constellation Mission and four sets of Starlink satellites. SXM-7 is one of two new digital audio radio service satellites that SiriusXM ordered from Space Systems Loral (now Maxar Technologies) in 2016. The satellite, weighing nearly 7,000 kilograms at launch, will generate more than 20 kilowatts of power and deploy a large antenna that will broadcast programming for SiriusXM subscribers in North America and the Caribbean. The satellite is intended to replace XM-3, a satellite launched in 2005 and operating at 85 degrees west in geostationary orbit. A second satellite, SXM-8, will launch in 2021 to replace XM-4 at 115 degrees west. The launch is the 24th orbital mission in 2020 for SpaceX, the most launches the company has performed in a single year. The SXM-7 launch, though, was only the third where the primary customer was neither the U.S. government nor SpaceX itself. Fourteen Falcon 9 launches have been of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites. Five have been for NASA, including commercial crew and cargo missions to the International Space Station and the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich ocean science satellites, while two have carried GPS satellites for the U.S. Space Force. SpaceX also performed a suborbital Falcon 9 launch in January as an in-flight abort test of the Crew Dragon spacecraft for NASA. Besides SXM-7, the only Falcon 9 launches for customers other than the U.S. government and SpaceX have been the July launch of the ANASIS-2 military communications satellite for South Korea and the August launch of the SAOCOM 1B radar imaging satellite for CONAE, Argentina’s space agency. One more Falcon 9 launch is scheduled for this year, carrying a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office on a mission designated NROL-108. That launch is scheduled for no earlier than Dec. 17.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-echostar-23/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — A SpaceX Falcon 9 launched the EchoStar 23 satellite early March 16 on the rare mission that did not attempt a recovery of the rocket’s first stage. The Falcon 9 lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2:00 a.m. Eastern. The launch was delayed by about 25 minutes because of upper level wind conditions. Poor weather scrubbed the previous launch attempt March 14. The rocket’s payload, EchoStar 23, separated from the Falcon 9 upper stage 34 minutes after liftoff, after being inserted into a geostationary transfer orbit. The satellite, built by Space Systems Loral, will ultimately operate at 45 degrees west in geostationary orbit. The launch was the third this year for SpaceX, and the second from the refurbished pad at KSC previously used for Apollo and shuttle missions. Unlike most other Falcon 9 launches, there was no attempt by SpaceX to land the rocket’s first stage, either on land or on a ship at sea. The heavy mass of the satellite, estimated to be about 5,500 kilograms, kept SpaceX from reserving any first stage propellant for a landing attempt. EchoStar 23 is designed to serve the Brazilian market with its Ku-band payload. In a Feb. 24 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, EchoStar Corp. said it expected to meet an in-service milestone of the second quarter of 2017 set by Brazilian regulators for use of the Ku-band spectrum on the satellite, assuming a launch by the end of March. In the same filing, EchoStar said it was seeking an extension of Ka- and S-band in-service milestones, also for the second quarter of 2017, from Brazilian regulators for that same orbital slot. The company cautioned that such an extension “may or may not be granted, and, if granted, may be subject to penalties, additional conditions or other requirements.”",

    "title": "SpaceX launches Canadian radar satellites",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-canadian-radar-satellites/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — A SpaceX Falcon 9 successfully launched a trio of Canadian synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites June 12 that promise higher resolution imagery with shorter revisit times. The Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base at 10:17 a.m. Eastern. The launch took place on schedule and without any issues despite dense fog that prevented the rocket’s liftoff from being seen. The Falcon 9’s first stage made a pinpoint landing nearly eight minutes after liftoff at the Landing Zone 4 next to the launch site. The launch was the second for that stage, which launched the company’s Crew Dragon spacecraft on an uncrewed test flight called Demo-1 from Florida in March. The rocket’s upper stage deployed its payload, the three-satellite Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM), about an hour after liftoff. The three satellites were released from the upper stage over a span of seven and a half minutes. MDA, the Canadian subsidiary of Maxar Technologies, built the three RCM satellites for the Canadian government. Each satellite weights 1,430 kilograms will be spaced evenly in the same 600-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit. The satellites’ C-band radars will be able to produce SAR imagery with resolutions as sharp as three meters. The development of the constellation, rather than a single satellite, is intended to increase revisit times. The system will be able to view 90 percent of the Earth’s surface every 24 hours, with enhanced coverage of Arctic regions. The satellites also carry Automated Identification System (AIS) sensors to identify and track ships. The RCM satellites ensure continuity with Radarsat-2, launched in December 2007. That satellite remains in service but is far beyond its seven-year design life, hence the desire by the Canadian government to get RCM in orbit to avoid anydata gap. The Canadian government expects to spend $1.2 billion Canadian ($900 million) on RCM, including the construction of the three satellites, their launch and operations over their projected seven-year lifetime. The government owns the full imaging capacity of the RCM constellation, unlike the Radarsat-2 mission where MDA Corp. sold imagery to the Canadian government and other customers. Sylvain Laporte, president of the Canadian Space Agency, said in May that the decision to transfer ownership of the expected 250,000 images RCM will take annually to the Canadian government was not a poor reflection on Maxar, but a desire to try a new approach with the program. “One of the primary reasons for the government owning the data is that we can then share it more freely,” Laporte said at a May 22 at a Space Transportation Association luncheon here. “When you buy commercial data, there could be contracting restrictions with how you share it, but now that we own the data we will see how beneficial that is.” Laporte said the Canadian Space Agency has already started planning the next generation of Radarsat for when RCM reaches its planned end of life in 2026. How Radarsat data will be controlled could change again with that generation, he said.  “I’ve tasked them to be creative with respect to the business model,” Laporte said. “It doesn’t have to be a repeat of what we’ve done already. We could try something different, and who knows where that is going to take us.” The launch was the seventh this year for SpaceX, including six Falcon 9 launches and one Falcon Heavy launch. The company’s next launch, of the U.S. Air Force’s Space Test Program 2 mission on a Falcon Heavy, is scheduled for no earlier than June 24 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The remainder of SpaceX’s launches scheduled for this year will take place from Florida.  Caleb Henry contributed to this article.",

    "content": "Updated 7:55 p.m. Eastern. WASHINGTON — After a variety of problems delayed four previous launch attempts, a SpaceX Falcon 9 successfully launched the SES-9 communications satellite March 4, although an attempted landing of the rocket’s first stage on a ship was not successful, as expected. The upgraded Falcon 9 lifted off at 6:35 p.m. Eastern from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket released the SES-9 satellite into geostationary transfer orbit 31 minutes after liftoff. The outcome of an attempt by SpaceX to land the rocket’s first stage on a ship about 600 kilometers downrange from the launch site was initally uncertain. Video from the ship was lost at the stage appeared to be approaching, and SpaceX ended its webcast coverage of the launch without providing an update on the status of the landing attempt. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk later tweeted that the rocket “landed hard” on the ship.  While that attempted landing, part of SpaceX’s ongoing efforts to make the first stage reusable, garnered considerable attention, SpaceX had warned leading up to the mission that a successful landing was unlikely. “Given this mission’s unique GTO [geostationary transfer orbit] profile, a successful landing is not expected,” the company stated in the mission’s press kit. “Didn’t expect this one to work,” Musk tweeted, citing high reentry speeds, “but next flight has a good chance.” This was the fifth attempt to launch SES-9. SpaceX canceled the previous attempt March 1 several hours before the scheduled liftoff time, citing high upper level winds that would have acted like a “sledgehammer” on the rocket had it flown through them, according to Musk. Three previous attempts were all delayed because of issues associated with the rocket’s use of “supercooled” liquid oxygen. The Feb. 28 launch attempt was aborted immediately after main engine ignition because of a low thrust alarm. Musk said that the liquid oxygen had warmed during a hold of more than half an hour in the countdown when a boat entered restricted waters offshore. SES had waited even longer for this launch, as the mission was originally scheduled for launch last fall prior to the Falcon 9 launch failure in June 2015. The Boeing-built SES-9 will operate at 108.2 degrees east in geostationary orbit. The spacecraft’s 81 Ku-band transponders will provide communications services for parts of Asia, Australia and the Middle East. The next Falcon 9 launch is tentatively scheduled for March 30, carrying a Dragon cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station. NASA officials said March 2 that an exact launch date for that mission would depend on when the SES-9 launch took place.",

    "content": "Updated 1:45 p.m. Eastern with comments from postlaunch press briefing. COLORADO SPRINGS — SpaceX launched a Crew Dragon spacecraft April 8 carrying four commercial astronauts to the International Space Station for Axiom Space. The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:17 a.m. Eastern from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The Crew Dragon spacecraft Endeavour, which previously flew the Demo-2 and Crew-2 commercial crew missions for NASA, reached orbit and separated from the rocket’s upper stage 12 minutes later. The rocket’s first stage, on its fifth flight, landed on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean. The stage previously launched SpaceX’s first non-NASA Crew Dragon mission, Inspiration4, last September, as well as two GPS missions and one set of Starlink satellites. Endeavour is flying the Ax-1 mission for commercial human spaceflight company Axiom Space. The spacecraft is scheduled to dock with the ISS at about 7:45 a.m. Eastern April 9 for an eight-day stay. “To say we are excited is a huge understatement,” Michael Suffredini, president and chief executive of Axiom Space, said at a postlaunch briefing about an hour after the Crew Dragon spacecraft reached orbit. Ax-1 is Axiom’s first mission and a key milestone in its long-term efforts to develop a commercial space station. The Ax-1 commander is Michael López-Alegría, chief astronaut for Axiom Space. A former NASA astronaut, he flew on three shuttle missions and one Soyuz mission, the latter for a six-month stay on the ISS. He holds NASA records for the most career spacewalks, 10, and cumulative spacewalk time, 67 hours and 40 minutes. After retiring from NASA a decade ago, he held several industry positions, including president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, an industry group. Larry Connor, one of the three customers of the mission, is also pilot of the Crew Dragon for Ax-1. He is founder and president of The Connor Group, a real estate investment firm in Ohio. He is a private pilot who has flown in aerobatic competitions and is also a race car driver. Eytan Stibbe is the second Israeli to go to space after Ilan Ramon, who died on the STS-107 shuttle mission in 2003. A former Israeli Air Force pilot, he is an investor who is calling his mission “Rakia,” a biblical term for the creation of the sky. Mark Pathy is a Canadian entrepreneur who is chief executive of Marvik, an investment and financing company. He is the 12th Canadian to go to space and the second Canadian private astronaut after Guy Laliberté, who flew to the ISS on a Soyuz mission in 2009. All four plan to perform dozens of experiments over more than 100 hours, supporting research from organizations such as the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Canadian universities and Israel’s Ramon Foundation and the Israel Space Agency. The Ax-1 crew emphasized they considered themselves “private astronauts” and not space tourists because of the research they will be doing and their extensive training. “Our guys aren’t going up there and floating around for eight days taking pictures and looking out of the cupola,” said Derek Hassmann, operations director at Axiom Space, said at a prelaunch briefing April 7. Accommodating that work, which also includes commercial activities and more than 50 hours of outreach activities, was a challenge to fit into the station’s overall schedule. “It was just a large amount of items to go through,” said Angela Hart, NASA commercial LEO program manager, at the postlaunch briefing. “It’s more than a 1,000-piece puzzle, I’ll put it that way, to fit all that together,” said Dana Weigel, NASA ISS deputy program manager, at the postlaunch briefing. The mission is a pathfinder for future commercial missions to the ISS, which themselves serve as a transition to the installation of commercial modules by Axiom on the ISS and, by the end of the decade, one or more commercial space stations that will succeed the ISS. “We’re super-excited to see this. We know we’re going to learn a lot from this first mission, working side-by-side in a very aggressive schedule on orbit during those eight days,” Hart said at the prelaunch briefing. “We’re committed to continue these private astronaut missions.”"

    "content": "Updated 10 a.m. Eastern with comments from post-launch press conference. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — SpaceX launched a Crew Dragon spacecraft carrying four astronauts from three nations April 23 as the commercial crew program moves firmly into operations. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Launch Complex 39A here at 5:49 a.m. Eastern on the Crew-2 mission. The Crew Dragon spacecraft separated from the Falcon 9 upper stage 12 minutes after liftoff, while the Falcon 9 first stage landed on a droneship in the Atlantic. On board the Crew Dragon are NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Akihiko Hoshide. Their spacecraft is scheduled to dock with the International Space Station at about 5:10 a.m. Eastern April 24. The mission is the third crewed flight of the Crew Dragon in less than a year, after the Demo-2 mission in May 2020 and Crew-1 mission in November. The Crew-1 spacecraft is still at the ISS, and it will return with NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker and JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi April 28. Leading up to the launch, NASA officials said that, after a decade of development, the commercial crew program — or, at least, SpaceX’s vehicle in that program — had clearly moved into operations. “It’s very, very exciting to be in this operational cadence,” said Kathy Lueders, NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations, during an April 15 press conference after the flight readiness review for the Crew-2 mission, which also reviewed plans to return Crew-1 to Earth. Kimbrough, the commander of Crew-2, said this mission was the first to follow the streamlined training flow that future missions will use. “We’re the first ones to have gone through what we hope to be the templated flows for future crews,” he said at an April 17 press conference. That revised training program, he said, combines training on the Crew Dragon spacecraft with that for the ISS. “It’s a little less than a year of training, where the crews in front of us had several years of training. Instead of being more developmental, it’s more operational now.” “This marks many important milestones, but it is really important for getting a regular cadence of crew to the station and back, and it’s going to really accelerate the research and the technology development we’re going to be to do on station,” Steve Jurczyk, NASA acting administrator, said at a post-launch briefing. “It took 10 years to get here, to achieve this bold vision we had for commercial crew.” “This has been a pretty amazing time with DM-2 and then the Crew-1 launch, and now we’re getting ready for Crew-2,” Bill Gerstenmaier, a former NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations who is now a SpaceX vice president, said at the April 15 briefing. He cautioned, though, that just because the commercial crew program is moving into a regular cadence of missions, it doesn’t mean crewed missions are routine. “We’re still beginning in this process. We need to not get lulled into thinking that this is fully operational and we’re ready to just continue this in an easy manner,” he said. “This is still very much a learning experience for us.” That learning experience extends to this flight, which marks the first use of both a previously flown Falcon 9 first stage and Crew Dragon spacecraft on a crewed mission. “We had to do an extensive amount of work to look at both the Dragon for use and also the F9,” Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager, said at that April 15 press conference. That review both examined the vehicles to ensure they met requirements as well as make a number of upgrades to the Crew Dragon spacecraft based on the experience from the Demo-2 mission. Those changes included upgrades to the SuperDraco thrusters and other aspects of the propulsion system used for aborts and improving the spacecraft’s batteries. “It was a series of upgrades to improve safety,” he said, “and having to make sure the structures, the component lifetimes were all within the certification and the qualification of those components.” While the missions are becoming more operational, it is still early enough in the program for astronauts to develop new traditions. “Even though there’s some heritage from previous vehicles on the U.S. side, we still get to create some new traditions, which is really cool,” said Pesquet. One thing the Crew-2 astronauts did that could become such a tradition, he said, is writing their initial in the soot on the Falcon 9 booster that will launch them. That soot is from the booster’s first launch, of the Crew-1 mission last November. “I don’t know if this is going to stick, but I found it really cool.” The best tradition, though, may be a safe and successful flight. “My takeaway from where I sit right now is that we’ve just got to be really careful,” Gerstenmaier said. “We’re still learning. This is still just the beginning of how we move forward into this new commercial area.” SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk, at the post-launch briefing, said he’s still nervous after what’s now three crewed flights. “It does get a little bit easier, but it’s still extremely intense,” he said. “I usually can’t sleep the night before a launch, and that’s true for the night before this one. I haven’t had much sleep.”"

    "title": "SpaceX launches first GPS 3 satellite",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-first-gps-3-satellite/",
    "content": "MT LAUREL, New Jersey — SpaceX launched the U.S. Air Force’s newest GPS satellite Dec. 23 on a Falcon 9 rocket, completing the company’s 21st and final launch of the year. The rocket lifted off at 8:51 a.m. Eastern from Cape Canaveral, Florida, following technical and weather-related delays that pushed the mission out five days. Its payload, the first GPS 3 satellite from Lockheed Martin, separated from the rocket one hour and 59 minutes later.  The launch was a double milestone for SpaceX, setting a new record over last year’s 18 launches, and fulfilling the company’s first defense mission competed through the Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program.  SpaceX’s record annual performance, which included the first-ever launch of a Falcon Heavy, was nonetheless short of the company’s initial forecast of  30 to 40 launches . SpaceX has increased its launch cadence rapidly, up from eight missions in 2016 and six in 2015 (Falcon 9 failures in both those years limited launch rates).  SpaceX has launched other national security missions, such as the National Reconnaissance Office’s classified NROL-76 satellite and the Air Force’s X-37B uncrewed spaceplane, both in 2017. The Air Force has selected SpaceX to launch another four GPS 3 satellites in addition to today’s mission.  SpaceX did not recover the Falcon 9 first stage, having devoted fuel that would have been used to land the booster instead to mission requirements for lofting the 4,400-kilogram satellite into a highly elliptical orbit. From there the satellite will circularize into a medium Earth orbit, joining the U.S.’s GPS constellation of 31 older satellites delivering positioning, navigation, and timing services to more than four billion users.  The new GPS 3 satellite replaces an aging GPS 2R spacecraft launched in 1997. Lockheed Martin is building the first 10 GPS 3 satellites through contracts awarded in 2008 and 2016. This September the Air Force selected Lockheed Martin to build  up to 22 more GPS 3 satellites  after reopening the program to competition amid schedule delays and cost overruns. The GPS 3 program is more than four years behind its original schedule for a first launch. Lockheed Martin said it has addressed the problems that beset the first few satellites, but the company was aided in winning the additional GPS 3 builds by the absence of Boeing and Northrop Grumman — two anticipated contenders that ultimately chose not to bid in the Air Force’s recompete.  GPS 3 broadcasts a stronger signal to counter electronic jamming. It will be the first GPS satellite to broadcast four civil signals, and the first to do launch and control checkout with the Air Force’s new ground control system: OCX Block 0. Because it’s the first of its kind, the checkout of the new satellite could take from six to nine months. On orbit checkout will begin about 10 days from launch. Once it’s declared operational, about six to nine more months of tests are planned to integrate the new satellite into the constellation. Lockheed Martin has manufactured 18 of the 31 GPS satellites currently in operation. The first GPS 3 vehicle is estimated to cost $529 million. It was nicknamed “Vespucci” after the Italian explorer. The GPS 3 satellites Lockheed Martin is building are designed to operate for at least 15 years. The Air Force intends to launch the second GPS 3 satellite next year.

    "content": "WASHINGTON — SpaceX launched 10 Iridium Next telecom satellites July 25 on a Falcon 9 rocket, bringing Iridium’s constellation one launch away from completion. The Block 5 Falcon 9 lifted off from a fog-enshrouded Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 7:39 a.m. Eastern. The rocket’s upper stage deployed the 860-kilogram Iridium Next satellites into low Earth orbit about an hour later. SpaceX successfully recovered the rocket’s first stage on the drone ship “Just Read the Instructions,” but was unable to catch the payload fairings, citing high wind shears. The crew on SpaceX’s fairing recovery boat “Mr Steven,” which was recently upgraded with a quadrupled-in-size catcher’s net, was in visual range of the fairings as they fell in the Pacific Ocean, according to SpaceX’s launch narrator.  SpaceX has made four attempts with “Mr Steven” and has added parachutes to payload fairings to slow their descent, but no captures have succeeded to date. SpaceX said it will continue attempting to recover the fairings, which cost around $6 million to make, according to the company.  McLean, Virginia-based Iridium now has 65 second-generation Iridium Next satellites in orbit. A final launch, also of 10 satellites on a Falcon 9, will complete the constellation, replacing the first-generation system that has been operating since the late 1990s.  The $3 billion Iridium Next constellation carries more powerful L-band payloads capable of providing up to 1.4 Mbps of connectivity to boats, planes and various satellite-connected devices. The cross-linked network also carries three sets of hosted payloads for other operators: aircraft tracking sensors for Aireon, ship-tracking sensors for exactEarth and space weather sensors for the U.S. Defense Department.  Once finished, Iridium Next will consist of 66 operational satellites, nine orbiting spares and six ground spares. European satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space is the prime contractor for the satellites, working with Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems to integrate the satellites in Gilbert, Arizona.  The final Iridium Next launch is expected “later this year” at Vandenberg, according to SpaceX’s launch narrator. ",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/terran-orbital-space-florida-deal-2021/",
    "content": "Updated 8:30 p.m. Eastern with comments from Terran Orbital and Space Florida. SAN FRANCISCO – Terran Orbital announced an agreement with Space Florida Sept. 27 to establish a manufacturing facility on Florida’s Merritt Island large enough to produce more than 1,000 satellites per year. At the Launch and Landing Facility, formerly known as the NASA Space Shuttle Landing Facility, Terran Orbital, the parent company of Tyvak and PredaSAR, plans to claim 10 hangars for what Space Florida calls “the world’s largest satellite manufacturing facility.” “Not only will we be able to expand our production capabilities to meet the growing demand for our products, but we will also bring valuable space vehicle manufacturing opportunities and capabilities to the State of Florida, investing over $300 million in new construction and equipment,” Marc Bell, Terran Orbital co-founder and CEO said in a statement. “By the end of 2025, we’re going to create approximately 2,100 new jobs with an average wage of $84,000.” The announcement comes one week after Terran Orbital  revealed plans to lease four floors  of an Irvine, California, office building for satellite design, engineering and development work. The highly automated 61,300-square-meter Florida facility, which is expected to take three years to complete, will feature additive-manufacturing technologies to speed up satellite manufacturing plus artificial intelligence to help Terran Orbital keep tabs on its supply chain. Space also will be set aside in the new Terran Orbital facility to produce and store “technologically advanced, printed circuit boards,” according to the Sept. 27 news release. Bell told SpaceNews that the factory is currently in its design phase, with construction expected to start in the middle of 2022. The $300 million cost will be covered by a “conduit financing” arranged through Space Florida. Dale Ketcham, vice president of government and external relations for Space Florida, said Terran Orbital is using private financing that Space Florida arranged. “We can put together an attractive financing package from the private sector so the debt is owed to the capital markets not the taxpayers,” he told SpaceNews, adding that Space Florida arranged similar financing for other projects. Space Florida received $38 million from the Florida Department of Transportation to build out infrastructure, such as utilities and roads, at the Launch and Landing Facility (LLF) to support Terran Orbital and other clients. “With Exploration Park all but filled up the LLF will be where we can next provide land for commercial space activities,” he said, referring to the business park just outside the gates of the Kennedy Space Center that is home to Blue Origin and OneWeb Satellites. “Satellite manufacturing is and will continue to be an important part of the economy in the Space Coast, and with this announcement we are upping the ante,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement. “In Florida, we are going to continue to take the lead on space by investing in infrastructure, training highly skilled workers and maintaining an economic climate that allows companies like Terran Orbital to thrive.” While state and company officials claim that the factory will be the largest satellite manufacturing facility in the world, Lockheed Martin’s Gateway Center outside Denver, where the company consolidated its satellite manufacturing work, is designed to have 325,000 square meters of production facilities, offices and other buildings when fully built out.

    "content": "Some years at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC), one person emerges as the star of the weeklong conference. Five years ago, it was Elon Musk, whose appearance in Guadalajara, Mexico, to talk about SpaceX’s next-generation launch system turned the conference into a rock concert — people lining up hours in advance and rushing in as soon as the doors opened — and also a bit of a circus, as his most ardent fans offered him comic books or kisses. There was no Elon Musk at this year’s conference in Dubai, but there was Martha Stewart. The domestic doyenne seemed like an unlikely choice to travel across continents to a space conference, but there she was on the conference’s final day, part of a panel discussing sustainable food development and its applications to deep space exploration. Stewart offered a lot of star power, but not a lot of pizzazz. As part of a nine-person, hour-long panel, she didn’t have many opportunities to talk, and didn’t have that much interesting to say when she did. She did express an interest in going to space someday: “If William Shatner can do it, I can do it.” The person who stole the show at the conference wasn’t Stewart or any of many current or former astronauts who spoke in Dubai. Instead, the unlikely center of attention, at least on the conference’s opening day, was Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos. Rogozin grabbed the spotlight through sheer force of will, specifically, his ability to talk, and talk, and talk. “I only have five minutes to tell you about our achievements,” he said during a heads-of-agency plenary session at the conference, then proceeded to talk for nearly 20 minutes. While having to speak through an interpreter contributed to some of that excess, he talked for far longer than the other five agency leaders on the panel, who stuck close to their allotted five minutes. His comments were a mix of updates on recent events, like the filming of a movie on the ISS, to more aspirational visions of satellite constellations, reusable launch vehicles and a nuclear-powered mission to Jupiter. A reusable rocket he showed looked remarkably similar to the Falcon 9; asked later about it, he gave a long-winded answer about costs and benefits of reusability before acknowledging that what SpaceX has done “commends a lot of respect.” Rogozin kept the attention at a press conference that followed, fielding question after question about space tourism, new rockets and the future of the International Space Station from Russian and international media, even after the moderator implored journalists to ask questions of the other agency leaders on stage. The spectacle was made even stranger by the poor sound system in the room that required reporters to walk up all the way to the stage to ask their questions, like supplicants approaching royalty. While there was a lot of bluster from Rogozin, there was also some news. Asked when he felt it would be safe for Russian cosmonauts to fly on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, he said that he believed it was safe to do so now, a statement that NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, also at the conference, considered significant in an interview later that day. What really matters, though, were the meetings behind closed doors, such as one between Rogozin and Melroy that day after Rogozin’s star turn at the conference. “It’s all about relationship building,” Melroy said in an interview after that meeting. “I felt good that we continued to deepen the relationship.” There were, though, no breakthroughs on commercial crew or the long-term future of the ISS. The Dmitry Rogozin Show is probably a fleeting one for the IAC: with sanctions against him in place in the U.S. and Europe from his role as deputy prime minister in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, it’s unlikely he’ll be able to reprise his role next year when the conference is in Paris. Maybe Elon can fill in instead.   Jeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for SpaceNews. His Foust Forward column appears in every issue of the magazine.

    "content": "TAMPA, Fla. — Satellite operator Viasat is asking the FCC to stop SpaceX from launching more Starlink satellites as it heads to court to compel a thorough environmental review of the rapidly growing megaconstellation. On Friday, Viasat formally asked the  Federal Communications Commission  to stay an April 27 license modification that allows SpaceX to continue building out the broadband constellation, which already numbers more than 1,600 satellites. Starlink surpassed the 1,584 satellites permitted under its previous license in 550-kilometer orbits soon after launching a fresh batch of 52 satellites May 15. SpaceX is slated to launch 60 more May 26. Viasat’s bid to stop or at least slow Starlink’s expansion rests on convincing a federal appeals court that the FCC was legally obligated to assess the megaconstellation’s environmental impact before approving SpaceX’s request to more than double the number of satellites it intends to operate from 550 kilometers.  The FCC originally approved a 4,409-satellite constellation, which included 2,825 satellites in orbits of 1,100 to 1,300 kilometers and 1,584 satellites at 550 kilometers. The FCC approved on April 27 a SpaceX application to modify that license, moving the satellites in the higher orbits to 550 kilometers and tweaking the size of the overall constellation to 4,408 satellites.  The company says it sought the modification to reduce latency, or signal lag, between space and the ground to improve video calls, gaming and other activities on the network. In December, the FCC  awarded SpaceX $890 million under the first phase of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), which aims to bring broadband service to unserved homes and businesses in the United States. Low latency was a key qualifying criterion for receiving funding.   Stopping Starlink Of the more than 1,600 Starlink satellites in orbit, roughly 700 have launched since January. A Falcon 9 launch slated for May 26 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, would be the 13th Starlink launch of 2021.  Viasat is asking the FCC to hit pause on further launches until federal courts can review the legality of the license modification.  Carlsbad, California-based Viasat, which provides broadband services from geostationary orbit (GEO),  had petitioned  the FCC to conduct an environmental review before granting the license modification as part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which currently categorically exempts satellite systems, but says this did not happen despite megaconstellations bringing new considerations for regulators. Some astronomers had also requested an environmental assessment, worried about how the constellation’s reflectivity affects ground-based telescope observations.  The FCC by and large rejected the requests when it  approved the license modification , although it did urge SpaceX to continue to work closely with astronomers to mitigate the brightness of its satellites. The FCC offered several reasons for not performing an environmental assessment, from questioning whether light pollution is covered by NEPA to noting that the Federal Aviation Administration does its own environmental reviews as part of the launch licensing process. Viasat said in a May 21 filing to the FCC that NEPA required it to at least consider environmental harms before granting SpaceX’s application, such as orbital debris, light pollution and the effect  disintegrating satellites could have  on the atmosphere.  “We believe the FCC failed to conduct a legally required environmental review under NEPA and did not honor the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to a science-based approach to protecting the atmosphere, the Earth’s climate, space and the well-being of U.S. citizens before authorizing the launch of thousands of new Starlink satellites into low-earth orbit,” John Janka, Viasat’s chief officer for global government and regulatory affairs, said in an emailed statement. “As such, we have asked the Commission to stay its order until the federal courts review its legality.”  If the FCC does not grant a stay by June 1, Viasat intends to go to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where it will seek a stay and review of the modification order. SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. In April, former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine joined Viasat’s board of directors. Bridenstine  told SpaceNews in an interview  at the time that the threat of megaconstellations to space safety, and the overall space access environment, were among issues on his radar. Viasat is developing a three-satellite ViaSat-3 broadband constellation in geostationary orbit (GEO) that will expand its operations globally, providing three terabits per second of throughput. The first Viasat-3 satellite will serve the Americas, targeting a launch early next year. Space News Senior Staff Writer Jeff Foust contributed to this story from Washington"

    "content": "SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea signed the Artemis Accords May 27, becoming the 10th signatory to the pact that governs norms of behavior for those who want to participate in the NASA-led Artemis lunar exploration program. On the same day, South Korea and the United States signed an agreement on “civil global navigation satellite systems cooperation” under which the U.S. will support South Korea developing its own satellite navigation system. The two events were follow-up measures of the May 21 summit between South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden at the White House, during which the two leaders agreed to strengthen the bilateral partnership in civil space exploration, science, aeronautics research and cooperate for effective joint response against security threats in space. “For successful space exploration, it is critical to implement space development activities transparently and responsibly by collaborating with the international community,” said Science and ICT Minister Lim Hye-sook who signed the Artemis Accords on behalf of the Korean government. “With the signing of the Artemis Accords, Korea would be able to strengthen cooperation with nations participating in the Accords in exploring outer space.” NASA’s chief celebrated South Korea’s coming on board. “I am thrilled the Republic of Korea has committed to the Artemis Accords. Their signature demonstrates the strong momentum worldwide in supporting our Moon to Mars exploration approach,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. “Partnering in deep space will ensure our missions are carried out in accordance with important, universal principles like transparency, safety, and peaceful exploration, which are critical to ensuring a safe, and prosperous future in space for all.” An initial area of cooperation is expected to include the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO), the nation’s first robotic lunar exploration mission, which is set to launch in August 2022 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to image the moon.   NASA provided an advanced lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera, nicknamed ShadowCam,  to the orbiter in a show of support. In return, a science ministry spokesperson said, the KPLO will be assigned work for NASA’s moon mission identifying areas with water. “For the Moon mission, it is critical to find an ideal landing area,” the spokesman told Korea JoongAng Daily.  “The KPLO will survey and bring together topological information about the Moon, and analysis of the data will play a significant role in selecting or adjusting the landing spot.” On top of this, shortly after the signing of the Artemis Accords, the science ministry said South Korea and the U.S. signed an agreement on “civil global navigation satellite systems cooperation,” under which the U.S. will support South Korea developing its own GPS, named Korean Positioning System (KPS).   South Korea plans to spend 4 trillion won ($3.56 billion) on building KPS by 2035  by launching seven new satellites — three into geosynchronous orbit and four into inclined geosynchronous orbit. The system is supposed to interoperate with the existing GPS, improving the accuracy of measurement across the Korean Peninsula significantly.  In a post-summit statement, released by the White House,  the U.S. said it will support South Korea’s KPS development and enhance its compatibility and interoperability with GPS. The signing ceremony was held online with senior officials from South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Science and ICT, U.S. State Department and U.S. Department of Commerce. “The Korea Positioning System is a critical infrastructure [for Korea] in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,”  said Shin Jae-sik, a senior official of the Space, Nuclear and Big Science Policy Bureau at the Ministry of Science and ICT, in a statement. “With U.S. support, we will be able to make a successful development.”  South Korea is the first of three countries expected to sign the Accords in the coming weeks, based on comments by NASA officials. “Many additional nations have expressed interest in signing the Artemis Accords, three of which are likely to do so in the next couple of weeks, representing several different regions of the world,” said Karen Feldstein, associate administrator for international and interagency relations at NASA, at a Royal Aeronautical Society conference May 19. Feldstein did not disclose what countries were likely to sign up, but industry sources say the most likely candidates are Brazil and New Zealand. Brazil signed a joint statement of intent with NASA in December, signaling its interest in joining the accords. New Zealand’s government was interested in the Accords last year, but was delayed by a general election in October. Eight countries originally signed the Accords in October during the International Astronautical Congress: Australia, Canada, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States. A ninth country, Ukraine, joined in November. SpaceNews senior staff writer Jeff Foust contributed to this story from Washington."

    "content": "COLORADO SPRINGS — At a press conference at the Kennedy Space Center in late July, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson deflected several questions about the future of the Artemis program and the agency’s ability to return humans to the lunar surface in 2024. He cited a blackout period imposed by the Government Accountability Office’s evaluation of protests filed by Blue Origin and Dynetics of NASA’s award of a single Human Landing System (HLS) contract to SpaceX in April. “I want you to ask me that question next week,” he said at one point, after the deadline for the GAO to rule on the protests. Next week has come and gone, but hasn’t given the agency the clarity it expected. The GAO dismissed the two protests, but Blue Origin filed a lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims Aug. 13, effectively appealing the dismissal of the protest. On Aug. 19, NASA announced it would voluntarily pause work on the HLS contract until Nov. 1 in exchange for an expedited review of the case. That’s not the only challenge facing Artemis. NASA supports adding a second company to the HLS program but is looking for Congress to provide billions of dollars in additional funding to do so, either through the standard appropriations process or a multi trillion-dollar package that Congress will take up through the budget reconciliation process. And a report by NASA’s Office of Inspector General Aug. 10 concluded that, even if the lunar lander is ready in 2024, the spacesuits the astronauts would wear on their Artemis 3 moonwalks won’t be done until 2025. SpaceNews Senior Staff Writer Jeff Foust spoke with Nelson about these issues, as well as his plans for this week’s 36 th  Space Symposium, in an interview Aug. 19 several hours before the agency confirmed that it would pause work on the SpaceX HLS contract while the Blue Origin lawsuit is heard in the Court of Federal Claims. Last month you had hoped that, once the GAO protest was concluded, you would be able to elaborate on your plans for Artemis. Where do things stand now? Further delay. Blue Origin has filed to the Court of Federal Claims, which in effect is like an appeal. It goes to a court equivalent to a federal district court where the judge could require, in essence, very laborious discovery. A lot of this will be dependent upon what the judge decides. Are you concerned the case could delay work on the HLS award to SpaceX? The lawyers at the Justice Department are the ones that handle the case. NASA does not handle the case. But my understanding from our lawyers, talking to the Justice Department lawyers who will present a case, is that they should have an idea on the schedule moving forward within the next two weeks. So, this is a matter that is out of our hands. It’s in the legal system and it’s being handled by the Department of Justice. You’ve expressed support for adding a second company to the HLS program, but that requires additional funding. What progress are you seeing in getting that funding from Congress? There are basically two avenues. In the appropriations process, I expect that to go all the way to the end of the year. Remember this is not just an appropriations bill but also the extension of the debt limit, and that’s going to be a political football. I think what is likely to happen is when you get to the new fiscal year, there will not be an agreement, so they will do a continuing resolution. What typically has happened in the past is that we’re either racing Santa Claus to get home, or one time we were actually in session on New Year’s Eve. So, the appropriations process, including the debt ceiling raising, is going to go until the end of this year. Another avenue is that you have a reconciliation bill passed. And that’s where I’ve asked for additional money for NASA over the next six years to do the full-up competition for the LETS [Lunar Exploration Transportation Services] contract, which is the contract for about a lander a year over the next decade. I’ve asked for that money and I’ve also asked for money for infrastructure because we’ve got a lot of infrastructure that needs updating. What’s my guess on a reconciliation bill that you have to have all 50 Democrats voting for in the Senate in order to get it passed? Your guess is as good as mine. In the meantime, that’s why we wanted to proceed with this interim step, what we’ve called NextSTEP Appendix N, which is basically a one-year transition — a bridge, if you will — to keep the other proposers going. Five of them have come in and offered proposals for Appendix N. The next step is an evaluation that will be done by an evaluation board. NASA’s Office of Inspector General issued a report earlier this month concluding that the spacesuits needed for the Artemis 3 lunar landing mission won’t be ready until at least April 2025. Does that mean a 2024 human return to the moon is off the table now? I can’t answer your question whether or not, because of delays on the spacesuit or what I just went through about the appropriations and with regard to the legal postures. I don’t know. In the near term, Artemis 1, the first Space Launch System mission, is approaching. Is that still likely to take place before the end of the year? If not the end of the year, then in January. What goals do you have for the Space Symposium, including meetings with heads of other space agencies?  First of all, you need to know that both [U.S. Space Force] General John Raymond and I have made a decision to cut back considerably, because of this delta variant of COVID. I will be there, but we decided that we need to cut the presence of the administrator’s office. So Pam [Melroy, deputy administrator] and Bob [Cabana, associate administrator] are not going to go, and our overall presence is going to be considerably reduced. However, I’m planning to go because there are a number of meetings with our international partners. Those will go as planned, although the international delegations are considerably cut back as well. I’m having one big kind of roundtable with industry, and we will limit that to one or two people per company, instead of a cast of hundreds of people, in a room that will be spread out, mindful of COVID. Those meetings are very important because this is a forum in which they can see me in the flesh and hear my ideas and get it straight from the horse’s mouth, instead of through the rumor mill or just through the written word. I’m looking forward to all this. We’re just going to be very sensitive to this raging fire called COVID, but in normal times, it’s a great time to press the flesh, to get to really know a lot of the players, and for mutual getting to know each other. And it’s too bad that we have to cut back, but you have to do what you have to do, given the question of the health of people. In those meetings with other space agencies, do you have any specific topics you’ll want to discuss, such as Artemis or extending the International Space Station to 2030? All of the above, and more. One agency leader who won’t be at Space Symposium is Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos. Do you still plan to meet with him later this year? I hope so, depending on any limitations imposed by COVID. Will that be in Russia? More than likely, yes.  You were very familiar with NASA before becoming administrator, but now that you have been on the job for three and a half months, has anything surprised you about the agency? Well, what does not surprise me is the level of competence, energy, and can-do spirit that I’ve always known in NASA. And as evidence of that, NASA was voted for the ninth year in a row as the best federal agency in which to work. Likewise, NASA was voted the best agency in the federal government to handle COVID. So, I’m not surprised because this incredible little agency does incredible things with incredibly skilled people. I wouldn’t call it a surprise, because I’ve known over the years that basically OMB always takes a sharp look at your budget. It’s up to us to convince them, and then to convince the Congress, to get the money that we need for cutting-edge technology. That keeps you on your toes all the time. But that’s what’s expected of us and that’s what we’re doing. And I think those are my observations.  My final observation is, I shouldn’t be allowed to have as much fun as I’m having."

    "content": "In February 2020, Astra was just starting to open up to the public. The small launch vehicle developer, which had kept a profile so low that it called itself “Stealth Space Company” in job listings, began talking to the media about its plans as it was preparing its first orbital launch attempt from Kodiak, Alaska, as part of the DARPA Launch Challenge. A year later, Astra was going public. The company announced Feb. 2 it would merge with Holicity, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) founded by Craig McCaw, who a quarter-century ago led Teledesic, the failed broadband satellite constellation. That merger, along with additional investment, will provide Astra with nearly $500 million in cash and value the company at $2.1 billion, with its shares traded on the Nasdaq exchange. Astra will use the funding to scale up production of its rockets, with a goal of launching nearly daily by 2025, and start a new line of modular satellite platforms. Chris Kemp, chief executive and co-founder of Astra, spoke with  SpaceNews  senior staff writer Jeff Foust a few days after the announcement, discussing the merger, Astra’s plans for ramping up launch activity and how it will compete against both small and large launch providers. The following is a condensed version of that conversation. We’re offering a cheaper, more efficient and less risky way for companies to get to space at Astra. So, it’s natural that we would take a cheaper, more efficient and less risky way to get to public markets. I think a SPAC, for us, was by far the most efficient path to public markets. From our perspective, there couldn’t be better partners out there for us. As we looked at the options in front of us, we got really excited about the background that Craig and the other folks had going back to the Teledesic days. They had a lot of pain that they felt trying to pioneer the first low Earth orbit communications constellation decades before Starlink. Launch was a big factor that scuttled their dreams. We’ve all seen what SpaceX has done solving that problem. We think there’s another opportunity that is very different, which is the hundreds of companies that are trying to solve a number of very important problems here on Earth from space, and we’re building a platform to address everything else. We believe fundamentally that small launches from anywhere on Earth anywhere in space means we can serve that market better. He’s been very actively involved. They’re not passive. He has participated in many calls we’ve had with investors and he’s joining my board. He’s someone who I am really looking forward to learning from and working with, as we build this company. There was a really careful look at everything from that flight. The fuel mixture was a bit off and changing the mixture would have easily put that payload in orbit. The same flight from a different spaceport or sent to a different orbit would have reached orbit. So, the system completely proved itself, and we will adjust the mixture ratio on the fuel. I think the next fight will be a commercial flight this summer with a payload on it. We’re ramping up our commercial launch operations this year. We’ll have monthly launches, starting in the fourth quarter. No changes. We’re ramping up production on this rocket. It’ll be called Rocket 3.3. And we’ll make lots of 3.3’s. There will be some little updates here and there, but it is exactly the same rocket configuration — engine, software, hardware — with minor enhancements, things that you’d want to do if you’re going to make lots of them. The team will start working on a rocket that can carry about 100 kilograms next year, after this gets handed off to production. There’s a whole roadmap that talks about effectively moving to about 300 kilograms to a 500 kilometer sun-synchronous reference orbit by 2023. In 2025, we hope to be hitting our daily launch cadence with a vehicle that can throw about 300 kilograms to a reference orbit. Ultimately, that means we can meet the needs of all these megaconstellations like Kuiper. The target for the company is being a megaconstellation provider. It’s really not the right strategy for any megaconstellation to have a single launch provider. All these companies, with the exception of SpaceX that owns their launch capability, will probably select two or three different providers, so they’re not locked in. But that leaves a remainder problem because the number of satellites that you can put on different rockets varies. Astra fills an important need, where we can fill in those gaps. You can get a batch of them where they need to go on a large rocket, and then you can fill in the remainder with Astra. We’ve done everything fast. We achieved this big milestone in December I think twice as fast as SpaceX and three times faster than Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit. We’ve already sold 50 launches. There’s so much demand and so many opportunities out there that we had to capitalize the business, to build the infrastructure to go and ramp up our launch rate and our production rate. One thing these customers all have in common is they all want to go to different places, on different schedules. That’s not possible with the SpaceX [rideshare] launch. That launch might have gotten a bunch of small satellites into one place in space, but those companies had to wait a very long time for that launch. It’s kind of like Airbus 380s versus small commuter jets. It’s never going to make sense to fly an Airbus 380 to Sacramento. You’re going to want to fly a small Embraer jet. So we’re doing the commuter jet, we’re filling in all the gaps. That’s, I think, a rising tide that will float all rocket ships, whether they’re big or small. We were producing about a rocket a quarter last year. We don’t intend to do more than that this year, because we’ll be investing this capital to scale the factory and really build the team out to start really preparing for monthly launch operations next year. We’ll be building out this quarter of a million square foot space, where we built about 100,000 square feet so far. We’re going to start construction in a few weeks and will be bringing in a whole bunch of new infrastructure to start scaling up production. It’s not like we’re making a handcrafted machine. We’re using aluminum. We can really manufacture these things at rate without a lot of labor and without a lot of custom machinery. It’s welding, it’s riveting. There’ll be robots. It will be a pretty lean factory operation. Yes, it’s less efficient than a carbon fiber rocket, but our goal as a company was never to make the most efficient rocket. It was to make the highest margin, most profitable company at scale. That’s what separates Astra from everyone else. It has been but it hasn’t been something we’ve talked about. We didn’t want to talk about it until we achieved this first milestone of reaching space with something that could deliver satellites. Now that we’ve got this milestone behind us, we’re opening up a little bit more about the long-term plan for the company. In fact, one of the things I’m working on now is the 100-year plan for the company. We’re really focused on this trillion-dollar economy that is largely focused on improving life on Earth from space, not going off Earth and settling other planets. If you think about every company that has ever started in this industry, they have to build the satellites from scratch, or they’re using this cottage industry of companies that integrate them. We see a model that’s much more like Apple or Dell, where customers just load software and they plug in a peripheral. And the peripheral is the camera, the sensor, the radio that is unique to their application. I think there’s a unique opportunity for us to completely turn the industry on its head by thinking about how we prioritize what’s actually happening in space versus the structural mechanics of how this industry has operated for many, many decades. We’re going to start building the capability to make them this year. Next year we’ll start flying the first prototypes. The following year, we’ll really start to productize and start providing space services to our customers. The satellite will fit inside of our rocket and be really beautifully designed to use every bit of space and mass available in the rocket. We need to have a high level of automation, so at the foundation of our platform is software. We had at our first launch of 1.0 about 30 people in Kodiak. In our 2.0 launch, we had about 15 people. In our 3.0 launches, we got it down to five. We now can take the entire spaceport, as we demonstrated with the DARPA Launch Challenge, pack it up into four shipping containers, unpack it, and launch the rocket with five people. We’re never going to go to a government spaceport. You’ll never see us build at Wallops or Cape Canaveral. We don’t want to be anywhere near those places. We want to deal with the FAA and they do a great job for us. I disagree with Elon [Musk] on this. I think that is a great group that’s been incredibly responsive. We want to have an environment where we can operate under their regulatory framework. It’s way easier than operating from the Cape or from Vandenberg. Yes, absolutely. We have engaged with several. If you look back at the Earth 50 years from now, or 100 years from now, there is a layer right above our atmosphere helping improve life on Earth. It’s an intelligent dust of connectivity that provides a level of capability here on the planet to better understand our resources, like really incredible, high-fidelity weather forecasting. Where are we hurting our coral reefs? What’s happening with methane? I cannot believe 100 years from now, looking back at Earth, there isn’t this beautiful protective sphere. And you can call that Astra. So, we’re building that. How do you build that? Is that a monopoly? No, it’s a platform, and that platform will be driven by standards and competition and global collaboration. Astra is building that platform, but it’s going to take decades. This transaction gives us the resources we need to begin that journey. This article originally appeared in the Feb. 15, 2021 issue of SpaceNews magazine."

    "title": "White House commits to ISS extension",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/white-house-commits-to-iss-extension/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — The Biden administration formally supports extending operations of the International Space Station through the end of the decade, an announcement that is neither surprising nor addresses how to get all the station’s partners, notably Russia, to agree on the station’s future. In  a statement published on NASA’s ISS blog Dec. 31 , NASA said the White House agreed to extend operations of the ISS through 2030. Federal law, last revised in 2015 with the enactment of the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, made it U.S. policy to operate the station through at least 2024. “I’m pleased that the Biden-Harris Administration has committed to continuing station operations through 2030,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in the statement. “The United States’ continued participation on the ISS will enhance innovation and competitiveness, as well as advance the research and technology necessary to send the first woman and first person of color to the moon under NASA’s Artemis program and pave the way for sending the first humans to Mars.” While the form and the timing of the announcement — a blog post rather than a formal press release, issued on New Year’s Eve — was a surprise, the decision to extend the life of the ISS was not. NASA had made clear its long-term plan for the station was to operate it through the end of the decade, providing enough time for commercial stations to enter service in the late 2020s and enable a smooth transition from the ISS to those commercial facilities. There have been several efforts in the last few years to formally extend the authorization of ISS operations in federal law from 2024 to 2028 or 2030. That included  an effort led by Nelson in his final days in the Senate in 2018  to pass a commercial space policy bill with that extension. That bill won approval in the Senate by unanimous consent in December 2018 but  failed to get the two-third majority needed to pass the House  via a legislative procedure known as suspension of the rules. The White House’s decision is alone not sufficient to continue ISS operations through the end of the decade. NASA said it would work with the station’s partners — Canada, Europe, Japan and Russia — “to enable continuation of the groundbreaking research being conducted in this unique orbiting laboratory through the rest of this decade.” One partner has already signaled its willingness to continue the ISS. “I welcome this announcement & will submit a proposal to Member States for @esa to continue until 2030, as well,”  tweeted  Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency, shortly after NASA published its statement. A bigger challenge, though, will be keeping Russia in the ISS partnership. Russian officials have expressed doubts about both the technical ability of the ISS to operate through the end of the decade given problems with the Russian segment of the station as well as a desire to develop a Russian national space station. “The current agreement is that we’ll keep operating it until 2024. It can, of course, keep flying after 2024, but every next year will come at greater difficulty,” Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos, said during a press conference at the International Astronautical Congress in Dubai Oct. 25. That difficulty, he said, was in the form of increasing technical failures and malfunctions. Geopolitics will also be a factor in Russia’s future participation in the ISS, particularly given fears in recent weeks that Russia will attempt to invade Ukraine. The station’s operations were not affected by sanctions from Russia’s annexation of Crimea and incursion into eastern Ukraine in 2014, but after a Dec. 7 call between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin,  U.S. officials said that “things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now.” Biden and Putin talked again Dec. 30. In a readout of that call, the Kremlin stated that Putin told Biden that any new sanctions against Russia would be a “grave error” and risks “a complete breakdown in Russia-U.S. relations.”",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — Firefly Aerospace is pausing preparations for its next Alpha launch, originally scheduled for early 2022, after the government asked its largest shareholder to divest its stake for national security reasons. Noosphere Venture Partners, a fund run by Ukrainian-born investor Max Polyakov, said Dec. 29 that it will retain an investment banking firm to sell its interest in Firefly. That sale comes at the request of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the company said.  Bloomberg was the first to report Noosphere’s plans . Firefly, in a statement to SpaceNews, said that, because of that request, it is holding off on preparations for its second Alpha launch. “During this process, the government has made a decision to limit our operations at Vandenberg Space Force Base while this issue is being resolved,” it stated. “Firefly is actively working with our government partners to mitigate any regulatory issues that may impact launch operations.” Space Launch Delta 30, the Space Force unit responsible for launch activities at Vandenberg, did not respond to a request for comment Dec. 29 regarding that pause on Firefly launch preparations. Polyakov acquired the assets of the former Firefly Space Systems in 2017 after it filed for bankruptcy. He invested $200 million to resurrect the company and allow it to continue development of its Alpha small launch vehicle,  which made its first orbital launch attempt in September . Noosphere said in its statement that it owns an “approximately 50% stake” in Firefly. It’s unclear what prompted the CFIUS request for Noosphere to sell its stake in Firefly, although the company speculated in its statement that it was linked to growing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, including concerns in recent weeks Russia would attempt in invade Ukraine. “Noosphere Ventures is working diligently to address CFIUS’s concerns in the most efficient and appropriate manner possible,” it said in a statement provided to SpaceNews. Polyakov’s ownership stake had not been a serious issue for Firefly in the past. The company secured access to Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg for its Alpha launch vehicle. It also won NASA contracts, such as an award from the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program for a lunar lander mission scheduled for 2023. Firefly, though, had been de-emphasizing Polyakov’s role in the company before the CFIUS notice. When  the company raised a $75 million Series A round in May , Noosphere sold an additional $100 million of its shares in Firefly, a move it said was to satisfy “overwhelming demand” from investors. Polyakov was also quietly dropped from the board of directors last year, which now includes former U.S. government officials such as Deborah Lee James, former secretary of the Air Force, and Robert Cardillo, former director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Before the government decision to halt Firefly launch preparations, the company had been gearing up for an Alpha launch as soon as late January. In  an interview in November , Jason Mello, president of Firefly Space Transportation Services, the Firefly subsidiary responsible for Alpha launch sales, said the premature engine shutdown that doomed the first launch had a “fairly easy and straightforward” solution. He said the company would conduct up to four more Alpha launches in 2022 if the upcoming launch was a success. Firefly did not mention in its statement how long of a delay it projected for its next launch because of the sale of Noosphere’s stake. “Our plans for multiple flights in 2022 are continuing with the finalization of Flight 2 testing and preparation for transport, along with the development of Flight 3 and 4 vehicles, which are currently in production,” the company stated. Firefly is not the first space company to be tripped up by national security concerns regarding foreign ownership. Momentus, which is developing a line of space tugs, was unable to get a Federal Aviation Administration payload review for its first mission in early 2021 because of government objections to its Russian co-founders, Mikhail Kokorich and Lev Khassis. That issue, which delayed its merger with a special purpose acquisition company, led to Kokorich and Khassis selling their stakes in the company. Momentus said in November that  it was making “significant progress” on implementing a national security agreement  with the federal government and was on track to get approvals for launching its first tug in the middle of 2022."

    "title": "JWST begins sunshield deployment",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/jwst-begins-sunshield-deployment/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has started the process of deploying the sunshield required to keep the spacecraft cold enough to operate, a process that is one of the riskiest aspects of the mission. NASA announced Dec. 28 the spacecraft controllers had started the multiday process of deploying the sunshield by lowering two components called Unitized Pallet Structures, one on the front side of the spacecraft and the other on the back. The front structure locked into position at 1:21 p.m. Eastern, followed by the rear one about six hours later. The structures contain the five-layer aluminum-coated Kapton sunshield. Once deployed, the sunshield will block sunlight from reaching the telescope and its instruments, allowing them to cool to their operating temperature of –233 degrees Celsius. Those cold temperatures are required for the telescope to function effectively for infrared observations. The lowering of the structures is only the start of a complex process to deploy the sunshield. After the tower that holds the telescope is extended, a process scheduled for Dec. 29, the sunshield covers will release the next day. Booms on the left and right sides of the spacecraft will extend a day later, after which cables will shape the five layers into their final form. The projected timeline for the mission calls for the sunshield deployment process to be completed Jan. 2. However, project engineers cautioned before the launch that deploying the sunshield was perhaps the most difficult process of the overall commissioning of JWST. “The sunshield is one of those things that is almost inherently indeterministic,” said Mike Menzel, lead mission systems engineer for JWST at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, during a November briefing. “The sunshield is one that has some risk to it.” At that same briefing, Krystal Puga, JWST spacecraft systems engineer at Northrop Grumman, compared the sunshield deployment process to a “Rube Goldberg machine” in that each step of the deployment triggers the next, using a combination of cables, pulleys and motors. She added, though, that she was confident that the sunshield will deploy as designed despite that complexity. “We performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-sized models,” she said. “This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully.”",

    "title": "Virgin Orbit raises far less than expected from SPAC merger",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/virgin-orbit-raises-far-less-than-expected-from-spac-merger/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Virgin Orbit will get less than half the money it originally expected from its merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) as that deal wins shareholder approval. Virgin Orbit announced Dec. 28 that shareholders of NextGen Acquisition Corp. II, a SPAC that announced in August it would merge with Virgin Orbit, had approved the merger. The deal is set to close by the end of the month, turning Virgin Orbit into a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol VORB. When the companies announced the merger, they projected raising $483 million for Virgin Orbit: $383 million from the proceeds of the SPAC and $100 million from a concurrent private investment in public equity (PIPE) round that included AE Industrial Partners and Boeing as investors. However, Virgin Orbit said in the statement that the merger will provide just $228 million in gross proceeds, with $68 million coming from SPAC proceeds. That suggests a high rate of redemptions, where shareholders of the SPAC exercise their right to get their money back rather than retain their shares in the merged company.  High redemption rates have been an issue for SPAC mergers  in general in recent months. The remaining $160 million comes from the PIPE, which includes the original $100 million plus additional investment from the Virgin Group and Mubadala Investment Company. Virgin Orbit announced Dec. 23 that the Virgin Group had agreed to invest up to $100 million in ensure the deal met the “minimum cash condition” of the merger agreement. The companies did not disclose in the announcement what that minimum cash condition was but said the $228 million raised was sufficient to meet it. According to  the merger agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August , the minimum cash condition was $200 million. It’s unclear what near-term effects, if any, the shortfall in capital will have on Virgin Orbit, but it may require the company to seek additional funding through a secondary offering. In  an August investor presentation , Virgin Orbit estimated needing $420 million in cash, starting in the second half of 2021, to reach positive cash flow in 2024. Despite the reduced capital, executives with Virgin Orbit and NextGen hailed the completion of the merger. “The capital raised through this transaction, combined with our new access to the public markets, will enable us to scale rocket manufacturing and extend our space solutions business and product development while we continue to expand globally through key partnerships with customers worldwide,” Dan Hart, chief executive of Virgin Orbit, said in a company statement. “I’m thrilled to support Virgin Orbit as it becomes a publicly traded business and builds on the incredible successes that we’ve seen this year,” Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Orbit, said in the statement. Branson and Virgin Orbit executives will celebrate going public with an “opening bell” ceremony at Nasdaq Jan. 7. That will take place days before the next Virgin Orbit launch, a mission called “Above the Clouds” and currently scheduled for no earlier than Jan. 12.",

    "title": "FAA delays completion of Starship environmental review",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/faa-delays-completion-of-starship-environmental-review/",
    "content": "SANTA FE, N.M. — The Federal Aviation Administration says it needs at least two more months to complete an environmental review of SpaceX Starship orbital launches from its Boca Chica, Texas, facility. The FAA said Dec. 28 that was unable to meet an original Dec. 31 deadline to complete an environmental assessment of plans by SpaceX to conduct orbital launches of its Starship/Super Heavy vehicle from the Boca Chica facility the company calls Starbase. That review, formally known as a Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA), is a key requirement for obtaining an FAA launch license needed for those launches. “However, due to the high volume of comments submitted on the Draft PEA, discussions and consultation efforts with consulting parties, the FAA is announcing an update to the schedule,” the FAA stated  on its website . “The FAA now plans to release the Final PEA on February 28, 2022.” The FAA received more than 18,000 public comments to the draft version of the report,  released in September . SpaceX is working to respond to those public comments under the supervision of the FAA, the agency noted, but did not give further details about the analysis of the comments. Two public hearings about the review in October  generated many comments both supportive and critical of SpaceX’s plans . The environmental review process also includes consultations with other government agencies. The FAA noted that those consultations involve those regarding endangered species and preservation of historical sites. The postponed completion of the environmental review means a delay in the award of an FAA launch license for Starship/Super Heavy orbital launches from Boca Chica. In November, SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said  he expected to get the launch license at the end of 2021 with a first orbital launch projected for January or February 2022 . It is not clear, however, that SpaceX would be ready for an orbital launch attempt on that schedule even if the environmental review and licensing process was completed as previously planned. Musk said in November that SpaceX would perform a “bunch of tests” of the Starship vehicle and its Super Heavy booster in December, but many of those anticipated tests, such as static fires, have not occurred yet. There is also no guarantee that the new Feb. 28 deadline will not be extended again. An environmental review of a proposed launch site in Georgia, Spaceport Camden, suffered a series of delays lasting months before  the FAA awarded a spaceport license for the facility Dec. 20 .",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Commercial lunar lander developer Intuitive Machines will launch its third lunar lander mission on a SpaceX Falcon 9, the same vehicle the company selected for its first two lander missions. Intuitive Machines announced Aug. 10 that its IM-3 lander mission will launch on a Falcon 9 in 2024. The Nova-C lander will carry up to 130 kilograms of payloads to the lunar surface. Company spokesman Josh Marshall said the company has not selected a landing site for the mission. The company previously selected SpaceX to launch its IM-1 and IM-2 lander missions, which are currently scheduled to launch in the first and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. The companies did not disclose the terms of the launch contract, but Marshall said the IM-3 award was a new contract and not an option on the previous contracts. Intuitive Machines\u2019 first two lander missions are carrying out task orders for NASA awarded under its Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. However, IM-3 is not linked to any CLPS missions. Marshall said that the mission \u201chas an open manifest for commercial and civil customers.\u201d \u201cOur turnkey solution for delivering, communicating and commanding customer payloads on and around the Moon is revolutionary. Now, we\u2019re proving we can do it at an annual cadence,\u201d Steve Altemus, president and chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said in a statement. In addition to payloads on the lander, the company says it will be able to fly up to 1,000 kilograms of secondary payloads attached to a dispenser ring. Those payloads would be deployed in a lunar transfer orbit from which they can maneuver to lunar orbit or other destinations. While Intuitive Machines continues to select SpaceX for launches, that relationship has not been without problems. IM-1 was scheduled to launch in late 2021, but Intuitive Machines disclosed in an April filing with the Federal Communications Commission that  the launch had slipped to early 2022 . Intuitive Machines said it was informed by SpaceX that \u201cunique mission requirements\u201d pushed back the launch, but neither it nor SpaceX would disclose what those requirements were. The award continues SpaceX\u2019s success in securing contracts for lunar lander missions. Of the six CLPS awards made by NASA to date, all are launching on SpaceX Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy vehicles other than Astrobotic\u2019s first Peregrine lander, which will launch on the inaugural United Launch Alliance Vulcan Centaur mission in 2022. SpaceX separately won a $2.9 billion NASA award in April to develop a version of its Starship vehicle for NASA\u2019s Human Landing System program, performing a demonstration mission to land astronauts on the moon on the Artemis 3 mission as early as 2024. The  Government Accountability Office rejected on July 30 protests filed by Blue Origin and Dynetics  regarding that contact.",

    "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 French startup Unseenlabs is set to fly its next maritime surveillance nanosatellite on an Arianespace Vega rocket in mid-August, instead of launching with Rocket Lab as it did for the first three BRO spacecraft the venture has launched since mid-2019. The Breizh Reconnaissance Orbiter-4 (BRO-4) is joining Arianespace\u2019s second Vega rocket mission of 2021, slated to lift off from French Guiana Aug. 16 at 9:47 p.m. Eastern. Vega\u2019s primary mission is to deploy the Pl\u00e9iades Neo 4 optical imaging satellite for builder and operator Airbus. Three European Space Agency cubesats are also joining the launch. The upcoming Vega mission will be the 19th time that Arianespace has launched the small launch vehicle, which made its maiden flight in 2012.  It is also the first  since returning to flight April 28 , following a Nov. 16 failure that destroyed its payloads.  Unseenlabs said it booked the mission with Arianespace in part to contribute to Europe\u2019s launch sovereignty. \u201cBeyond the technological and commercial considerations, I think it is a great opportunity to test a new launcher that will help guarantee and accelerate our access to space,\u201d said Jonathan Galic, Unseenlabs co-founder and chief technology officer.  Unseenlabs said BRO-4 expands a constellation that has been operational since U.S. and New Zealand-based Rocket Lab launched BRO-1 in August 2019, followed by BRO-2 and -3 in November 2020. The startup is building out a radio-frequency geolocation constellation that enables customers to monitor and track signals from ships at sea. Applications range from providing maritime companies up-to-date data on ship positions to giving governments more tools for tackling illegal fishing. Unseenlabs said April 27 it raised 20 million euros ($25 million) to help grow its constellation by 2025 to between 20 and 25 satellites, up from the four it will have in orbit with a successful launch of BRO-4. Other startups are chasing similar markets with their own satellites. British company  Horizon Space Technologies raised funds  for its radio-frequency-mapping maritime surveillance system in May. U.S.-based HawkEye 360 has a substantial foothold in the market and launched its latest cluster of three satellites in June,  after raising an additional $55 million  in April. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1515201170046-0'); })",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 NASA plans to delay the next phase of its Mars Sample Return campaign and split a lander mission into two separate spacecraft to reduce the overall risk of the program. At a March 21 meeting of the National Academies\u2019 Space Studies Board, Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA associate administrator for science, revealed that NASA and the European Space Agency had agreed to revise the schedule and design for upcoming missions that will return samples being cached by the Perseverance rover to Earth. Original plans called for the launch of both a NASA-led Sample Retrieval Lander and ESA-led Earth Return Orbiter in 2026. The lander, using an ESA-built rover, would collect the samples cached by Perseverance and load them into a rocket called the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), which would launch them into orbit. The orbiter, using a NASA-provided collection system, would gather the samples and return them to Earth in 2031. An independent review, though,  recommended in November 2020 that NASA delay those future missions to 2027 or 2028 to provide a more reasonable development schedule . Another panel recommendation was for NASA to investigate turning the single Sample Retrieval Lander spacecraft into two separate landers, one carrying the rover and the other the MAV. Zurbuchen told the Space Studies Board that NASA and ESA had agreed to split the Sample Retrieval Lander into two landers, which would now launch in 2028. \u201cThe Phase A analysis demonstrated that, frankly, the single lander breaks entry, descent and landing heritage. It is actually high risk,\u201d he said. The single-lander approach would require a larger heat shield, estimated to be 5.4 meters in diameter, which in turn would require a larger payload fairing for the rocket launching it. The design also had \u201cunproven\u201d entry, descent and landing capabilities and would require electric propulsion on the cruise stage to increase its payload performance. A dual-lander approach, he said, could make use of the same landing system used by Perseverance and, before that, Curiosity. \u201cIt can be completed in the \u201920s, just like we want to,\u201d he said, and avoids the complexity of the larger design. Both NASA and ESA agreed to adopt the approach as well as a schedule that would delay the launches of the two landers to 2028. The Earth Return Orbiter would launch in 2027, and the samples would return to Earth in 2033 under that revised schedule. Zurbuchen said one lander, dubbed SRL1 and carrying the MAV and a robotic arm for sample transfer, would be built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory because of \u201ccriticality and integration.\u201d NASA had not yet decided on who would build the second lander, SRL2, which will carry the fetch rover. The decision, he said, would come by June, when the mission reaches a programmatic milestone called Key Decision Point B. He did not discuss the cost implications of the schedule or design changes. Shortly before the launch of the Mars 2020 mission carrying the Perseverance rover,  NASA and ESA officials estimated that the overall Mars Sample Return campaign would cost at least $7 billion . NASA will not make formal cost estimates of its future lander missions until the later Key Decision Point C review, although the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2023 budget proposal, due for release March 28, may contain some additional details. A complicating factor for Mars Sample Return plans is the delay in ESA\u2019s ExoMars rover mission, which was to launch in September until  the agency suspended its partnership with Roscosmos earlier this month  after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. ESA is now considering options for going forward with the mission that would delay its launch to at least 2026. ESA officials said March 17 that those options could include a renewed partnership with NASA. Zurbuchen alluded to those comments in his remarks at the meeting but did not elaborate on any NASA role in ExoMars. \u201cWe are having a lot of discussion with our European colleagues that may or may not affect some of the discussions here related to ExoMars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to them to talk about that.\u201d",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/spinlaunch-conducts-first-test-of-suborbital-accelerator-at-spaceport-america/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 SpinLaunch, a company developing an alternative launch system that fires payloads at hypersonic speeds from a ground-based centrifuge, successfully fired its first projectile from a subscale version of its accelerator. The test took place Oct. 22 at Spaceport America in New Mexico,  where the company built a version of its accelerator  33 meters in diameter. That accelerator spun up a projectile three meters long, releasing it at high speeds into the skies. \u201cThis was the first time we put all the pieces together,\u201d Jonathan Yaney, chief executive of SpinLaunch, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big moment for us.\u201d The centrifuge ran at 20% of its maximum power, he said. He declined to give specific details about the projectile\u2019s flight, but said it flew at supersonic speeds and reached altitudes of \u201ctens of thousands of feet.\u201d The projectile was instrumented and collected data, but did not have any active controls, instead flying a ballistic trajectory. The system was designed to test the overall concept behind SpinLaunch, which uses a centrifuge in a large vacuum chamber to accelerate a projectile, releasing it at hypersonic speeds. The accelerator serves as a first stage of a launch system, with the projectile carrying rocket engines that act as upper stages to place a payload into orbit. The accelerator \u201cperformed amazingly\u201d in the October test, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really huge milestone and it\u2019s validated all of our efforts.\u201d SpinLaunch is planning a series of 30 tests over the next six months of the suborbital system. \u201cFrom here, we really just keep increasing power, and we\u2019ll be putting more components and subsystems of our orbital launch vehicle into this launch system, which will allow us to validate ideas and try new things,\u201d Yaney said. Building the system in a remote location at the spaceport was difficult, he said. \u201cBeing an hour away from any kind of civilization and support certainly presented its own set of challenges,\u201d he said, exacerbated by extreme weather conditions there. \u201cWe needed a location that was a combination of being affordable, gave us the freedom to move quickly, and had airspace that goes all the way to the edge of the atmosphere.\u201d He said the spaceport and the New Mexico state government was \u201cincredibly supportive\u201d of their activities. About half of SpinLaunch\u2019s 200 employees are based in New Mexico, with the rest in its Long Beach, California, headquarters. The company has been scouting coastal locations to build a larger version of the accelerator, about 100 meters across, needed for orbital launches. \u201cWe are in the late stages of finalizing our agreements on our launch site,\u201d Yaney said, with an announcement planned \u201cin short order.\u201d The design of that system will be finalized and construction beginning in the next year. That would set the company up to begin orbital launches in 2025, he said. SpinLaunch has been working on other elements of the system besides the giant accelerator, such as the rocket engines that will serve as upper stages to place payloads weighing up to 200 kilograms into orbit. Those engines will be standard bipropellant designs, he said, but be \u201cincredibly low-tech versions\u201d with pressure-fed systems and few parts, intended to be built cheaply and in large quantities. The company has also been testing how spacecraft components can high the high-g environment of the accelerator. \u201cVery few people have experience designing mechanical and electronics systems to go into a high-g centripetal environment. It\u2019s just a unique environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty surprising to learn how benign of an environment it is, and how not challenging the design effort turns out to be.\u201d The payoff for all that effort is a launch system the company believes can send payloads to space several times a day at costs far less than conventional rockets. \u201cThe rocket equation has always been this gating function on how inexpensively you can launch something into orbit,\u201d Yaney said. \u201cSpinLaunch sets out to disrupt that.\u201d  SpinLaunch projects that, on a per-kilogram basis, the system will be less expensive than \u201cincumbent large-scale launch vehicles\u201d in service today, he said. \u201cIt will also be 10 to 20 times less expensive than the emerging small launch systems. We\u2019ve developed a system that is very disruptive and very well-suited to launching the next generation of large-scale low Earth orbit satellite constellations.\u201d Seeing the system operate for the first time last month was \u201csurreal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous feeling of accomplishment, almost disbelief and wonder, that we took something that the world had never seen before, this entirely brand-new technology, and birthed it into existence.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Following a meeting Nov. 10 with French President Emmanuel Macron, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris announced both nations agreed to expand cooperation on space and cybersecurity issues. The U.S. and France will engage in a \u201ccomprehensive dialogue on space,\u201d the White House said in a news release.   Representatives from U.S. civil and national security space agencies and their French counterparts will establish \u201cregular bilateral dialogue to ensure a whole-of-government approach to space cooperation.\u201d The White House said space cooperation will focus on several areas of concern to both nations: To help tackle climate change, the U.S. and France agreed to step up the exchange of Earth observation satellite data and conduct joint analysis of climate change risks. Harris, who chairs the U.S. National Space Council, also announced that the United States is committed to joining the  Space Climate Observatory  (SCO) and \u201clooks forward to working with France\u2019s National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) to finalize the SCO Charter.\u201d The SCO was officially launched by Macron in 2019 as a consortium intended to sponsor projects that help make data from space more accessible to organizations to inform decisions and measures to mitigate and respond to the climate crisis.   To date, 33 space agencies and international organizations have joined the consortium. France has the third oldest national space program in the world, after the U.S. and Russia, and the largest space program in Europe. France in July 2019 released its first French Space Defense Strategy, which elevated the role of French military space programs. Harris after the meeting with Macron also announced the U.S. will support the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a voluntary commitment to work with the international community to advance cybersecurity and preserve an open, interoperable and reliable internet. Harris visited France at the invitation of Macron. Relations between the U.S. and France deteriorated after it was revealed in September that the U.S. and the U.K. agreed to sell nuclear submarines to Australia, which derailed a previous deal Australia had signed to buy diesel submarines from France. The White House on Thursday said Harris \u201cwelcomes President Macron\u2019s expression of France\u2019s intent to join the Artemis Accords, a coalition of like-minded countries committed to ensuring that space exploration is conducted responsibly and sustainably.\u201d Launched in October 2020, the  Artemis Accords  are voluntary, non-binding principles to promote cooperative, peaceful civil exploration of outer space.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/space-startups-an-investment-target-for-big-defense-contractors/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For large defense and aerospace firms looking to up their innovation game, investing in commercial space companies can be a winning strategy, said Ronald Epstein, senior equity analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Investing in or outright acquiring space industry startups \u201cI think is an important way for a big company to remain innovative and nimble,\u201d Epstein said Nov. 10 at a Foundation for the Future online conference on space ventures.   Big DoD contractors need to \u201cbe able to bring in creative forces and ideas,\u201d he said, adding that Lockheed Martin has pursued that strategy successfully so far. The company owns 50% of United Launch Alliance and in recent years has invested in a number of commercial space companies including  Terran Orbital,  Rocket Lab,  ABL Space Systems  and Orbit Fab.   Raytheon recently acquired commercial satellite manufacturer  Blue Canyon Technologies  and the spacecraft engineering firm  SEAKR .  Boeing  has made an investment in Virgin Orbit.  Northrop Grumman also has invested in  Orbit Fab . Epstein noted that Lockheed\u2019s third-quarter financial results revealed \u201csome hiccups in some of their big defense programs. But they also took some positive gains on some of their investments.\u201d These gains are \u201cpeanuts compared to the F-35 [fighter aircraft program] but it\u2019s going in the right direction,\u201d he said. Further, investments in commercial technologies are \u201cfeedstock for future innovation at the company.\u201d Epstein, who also is a mentor to startups at the Techstars accelerator, said large defense contractors spend very little of their own money on innovative research and development. \u201cAny defense contractor that\u2019s listening to this would probably take issue with this comment, but it\u2019s true,\u201d he said. On average about 95% of the R&D done by these larger firms is funded by the government. \u201cSo it\u2019s not really research, it\u2019s revenue generating research that is customer funded and is what the customer wants.\u201d Big defense firms can provide startups much needed funds to pursue cutting-edge technologies  but businesses need to be understand investors\u2019 motivations, said Michael Mealling, general partner at Starbridge Venture Capital. Seeking investments from large primes can work out well for many space firms \u201cbut you\u2019ve got to realize that you\u2019re playing with a Tyrannosaurus rex,\u201d Mealling said Nov. 9 at the Foundation for the Future conference.   \u201cYou may end up as the egg dancing with the chicken that might eat you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the risk. And we\u2019ve seen that happen a lot.\u201d An emerging sector of the space industry where small firms are likely to be acquired by conglomerates is in-space computing, Mealling said.   \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations around in-orbit compute capability at significant scale,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so anybody that\u2019s working on that has to understand that the large cloud players can easily move into that market, and you have to understand their motivations for wanting to work with you \u2026 Some of those conversations are difficult. And sometimes they can get contentious.\u201d",

    "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Canadian satellite operator Telesat expects to start publicly trading shares next week, broadening potential funding sources for its delayed $5 billion low Earth orbit Lightspeed broadband network. Telesat expects to finish its merger with Loral Space & Communications, a major shareholder that already trades on the Nasdaq, Nov. 19 following a two-day closing process. The company will list on the U.S.-based stock exchange if the merger goes ahead as planned. It is still awaiting confirmation from The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) to trade shares in Canada. Although Telesat is not raising funds through the process, being \u201cpublicly listed will give us access to the public equity markets for growth initiatives, including Telesat Lightspeed,\u201d a Telesat official said. The company has already received commitments for about two-thirds of Telesat Lightspeed\u2019s projected $5 billion cost, including about $1.15 billion from Canada\u2019s government. Talks with export credit agencies are still ongoing about securing debt to finance the rest of the constellation of   nearly 300 broadband satellites. \u201cWe expect to complete the Telesat Lightspeed financing with the Export Credit Agencies in the near term,\u201d the Telesat official said in an email. Diversifying funding sources is becoming increasingly important for the operator as pandemic-related component shortages cause delays at Europe\u2019s Thales Alenia Space (TAS), which is prime manufacturer for Lightspeed under a $3 billion   contract. Dan Goldberg, Telesat\u2019s CEO, said during the company\u2019s quarterly financial results call Nov. 5 that TAS \u201crecently informed us that the global supply chain issues out there will delay the construction of the Lightspeed satellites, which in turn will delay our getting into commercial service.  \u201cWe\u2019re working with Thales now to get a better sense of the magnitude of the delay, whether there are steps we can take to mitigate the delays, and whether there are any further optimization we should consider for the Lightspeed design if we have a little more time.\u201d He added that the delay with TAS is also holding back \u201cour ability to  complete our financing arrangements with the export credit agencies.\u201d Deployment delays also increase the risk of Telesat missing regulatory deadlines for operating Lightspeed. A Telesat official said the company does not anticipate any issues with the operator\u2019s ITU filings, however, it will need to seek an extension to meet commitments made with the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cIn regards to the FCC, Telesat does not expect to deploy 50% of its currently-authorized satellites prior to the FCC\u2019s 50% deadline of November 3, 2023,\u201d the official told  SpaceNews . \u201cHowever, we can seek a waiver under precedents in which the FCC has extended milestones based on factors such as substantial expenditures and concrete progress toward completion of satellite construction.\u201d Telesat posted a 2% fall in total revenues to 192 million Canadian dollars ($154 million) for the three months to Sep. 30, compared with the corresponding period in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, fell 1% to 157 million Canadian dollars for the quarter.",

The U.S. Missile Defense Agency  in January selected  Northrop Grumman and L3Harris to develop sensor satellites known as Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS). Northrop Grumman announced Nov. 10 that its satellite passed a critical design review, which means MDA upheld the company\u2019s technical approach for detecting and tracking ballistic and hypersonic missiles from low Earth orbit. The HBTSS satellites are part of DoD\u2019s planned multi-layered network of spacecraft that can sense heat signatures to detect and track missiles from launch through their entire flight trajectory. After the HBTSS prototype is delivered, Northrop Grumman said it will conduct an on-orbit test to demonstrate its ability to track hypersonic threats, process sensor data and hand off the information to command centers so the missile can be intercepted. A long-term vision for HBTSS is a constellation of satellites connected by optical cross links than can provide global coverage, and detect and track multiple targets.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/momentus-makes-progress-implementing-national-security-agreement/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In-space transportation company Momentus says it\u2019s making progress in implementing a national security agreement that would allow the company to secure the licenses needed for its first mission. In its first quarterly financial results since  completing a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in August , Momentus executives said Nov. 9 they are working on both technical and regulatory fronts toward a first launch of its Vigoride tug on a SpaceX rideshare mission in June 2022. Momentus attempted to launch its first Vigoride tugs in January and June of this year on other SpaceX rideshare missions, but the Federal Aviation Administration rejected the payload review for the vehicle, citing concerns raised by the Defense Department about the company\u2019s Russian co-founders and owners. That led to an agreement by Momentus to acquire those co-founders\u2019 shares for $40 million and also enter into a national security agreement (NSA) with the federal government to address those concerns. \u201cMomentus has already made significant progress on NSA implementation,\u201d John Rood, chief executive of Momentus, said in an earnings call. Of the 62 discrete tasks in the agreement, he said the company had implemented a \u201cmajority\u201d of them had had made progress on the remaining items. \u201cWhile this involves a heavy upfront lift as many legacy IT systems and internal processes are being replaced by new ones, we believe diligent implementation will create a stable regulatory environment around the company and our activities,\u201d he said. Rood said later in the call he was confident that the remaining work to implement the NSA would be completed in time to launch its first Vigoride in mid-2022. \u201cWe feel good about our chances to fly in June,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do need to do some additional work between now and then, but overall, we believe we\u2019re on pace.\u201d The company said it signed a new launch services agreement with SpaceX Oct. 20 to fly a Vigoride tug on SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-5 dedicated rideshare mission in June 2022. That launch, though, will depend on its ability to fully implement the NSA and get the licenses required for the mission. The company is currently building the Vigoride 3 tug that will launch on that mission. Rood said the vehicle is undergoing \u201csome rework\u201d after system-level tests in advance of thermal vacuum testing. \u201cWe expect Vigoride 3 to be fully qualified in the first half of the year, before our planned inaugural launch,\u201d he said. That mission will largely be a demonstration of the vehicle, although he said it will also carry some customer payloads and generate a \u201csmall amount\u201d of revenue. \u201cHowever, the primary goals of the mission are to test Vigoride on orbit, learn from any issues that we encounter, and take important steps towards establishing the viability of our initial market offering.\u201d He indicated that two earlier Vigoride vehicles built and tested by Momentus will remain on the ground. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a significant amount from production of these initial vehicles that we plan to retain in storage and potentially use for testing as we apply the lessons learned to future Vigoride vehicles that we plan to fly.\u201d After the scheduled June launch, Momentus projects flying a second Vigoride vehicle in the second half of 2022, pending the outcome of the first flight and ability to secure a launch slot. Vigoride is intended to be the first in a series of tugs, with previously announced plans for larger vehicles called Ardoride and Fervoride. However, Rood said the company is pushing back development of those larger vehicles to focus on Vigoride. \u201cTo be clear, we still plan to develop these larger vehicles, although development will take place over a longer period than previously anticipated,\u201d he said. Momentus reported $200,000 in revenue in the third quarter, which chief financial officer Jikun Kim said came when a customer terminated a contract and forfeited its deposit. The company had a net loss for the quarter of $5.6 million. Kim said the company has $178 million in cash on hand after the completion of its SPAC merger, which is \u201csufficient to carry us through to the early part of 2023.\u201d",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/u-s-interagency-panel-to-update-rd-strategy-to-tackle-orbital-debris/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration plans to update an existing research-and-development plan aimed at combatting orbital debris. Overseeing the orbital debris R&D plan is an interagency group within the National Science and Technology Council that deals with national security and space issues. The NSTC reports directly to the president.   The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy said in a Federal Register notice Nov. 5 that the orbital debris interagency group is drafting a plan to be released in 2022 and is soliciting  public input through Dec. 31. The updated strategy will build off an existing R&D plan on orbital debris  released by the Trump administration  in January 2021. That document noted that a lack of coordination among U.S. departments and agencies makes it difficult to \u201cadvance a common national vision for orbital debris risk management.\u201d A new debris-focused technology effort that is just getting under way is led by the U.S. Space Force. The project, called  Orbital Prime , will be discussed by the interagency group that focuses on debris remediation technologies, Lt. Col. Brian Holt, project lead at SpaceWERX, told  SpaceNews.   \u201cDoD, including Space Force will be represented,\u201d he said. Orbital debris is creating collision hazards across the space environment surrounding the Earth but is particularly concentrated around the most widely used low orbits below 2,000 kilometers in altitude. The U.S. government estimated there are more than 8,000 metric tons of orbital debris from low Earth orbit to geosynchronous Earth orbit 36,000 kilometers above the Earth. Space industry consultant Patricia Cooper, a former vice president of government affairs at SpaceX, said there are internal disagreements in the U.S. government about how to deal with orbital debris. Further, the U.S. alone can\u2019t fix the problem and needs cooperation from other nations that launch satellites into space.   A long-standing guideline  requires deorbiting satellites within 25 years and there is a growing push to shorten that. \u201cThere are some in NASA who think that it\u2019s more important to enforce that rule than it is to make it even tighter,\u201d Cooper said at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\u2019 ASCEND 2021 conference.   \u201cSo there\u2019s still some problems even enforcing that,\u201d she said. With regard to commercial LEO constellations, \u201cthere\u2019s been a robust discussion about whether propulsion is important, or having a plan to de orbit, and there\u2019s been some very good discussion about how much time after the end of the mission should elapse particularly at different altitudes, and whether that needs to be propulsive.\u201d But there are still basic questions haven\u2019t been answered yet, Cooper said.   A significant challenge is that many home countries of where constellations are licensed don\u2019t have any debris mitigation rules published, \u201cand you cannot see what their plans are,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a concern and I think maybe unduly puts the emphasis on the U.S. because everyone\u2019s plans that are U.S. filed must be made public. But if you filed in Rwanda or China, your space safety approach is not published.\u201d Despite these hurdles, said Cooper, \u201cI see a good deal of resolve. There\u2019s definitely a sense of imminent need.\u201d",

    "content": "HELSINKI \u2014 China carried out its 37th orbital launch of the year Thursday, successfully sending the Chinese H-alpha Solar Explorer and 10 other satellites into orbit. A Long March 2D lifted off from Taiyuan, north China, at 6:51 a.m. Eastern, Oct. 14. The rocket used a new configuration to allow it to deploy more than 10 satellites for the first time while the first stage also included grid fins\u2014following  earlier  tests on other Long March rockets\u2014to constrain the expected drop zone of the stage downrange. The main payload was China\u2019s first solar observatory, the Chinese H-alpha Solar Explorer, with a target 517-kilometer-altitude Sun-synchronous orbit.  An orbital atmospheric density detection experimental satellite (MD-1) and a commercial meteorological detection constellation experimental satellite (QX-1) were also aboard the flight, Xinhua  reports . The  pair  were developed by small satellite developer Shenzhen Aerospace Dongfanghong Satellite Co., Ltd, ultimately owned by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).  The China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC), a subsidiary of CASC, lists further satellites on the flight to be named as MD-1, Tianshu-1, QX-1, the Golden Bauhinia N2 satellite developed by Hong Kong Aerospace Technology Group Limited and  Commsat  for a constellation to cover the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, MOTS and  Tianyuan-1 , as well as Head-2 E and Head-2 F for the HEAD Aerospace Group.  Tianshu-1  is a test satellite for low Earth orbit navigation enhancement for Insight Position Digital Intelligence Technology Service Co., Ltd.  MOTS refers to a VHF Data Exchange System (VDES) experiment  satellite  developed by Shanghai Lizheng Satellite is expected to form the basis for a Chinese maritime communication constellation. The last pair of satellites were for a Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO) student small satellite  project , namely the SSS-1 Micro Satellite and SSS-2A Cube Satellite.  The 508-kilogram CHASE is tasked with acquiring the first full-disk spectroscopic solar observations in the H-alpha deep-red visible spectral line waveband. CHASE will study solar activity and provide critical data for space weather forecasting, including observing filaments prior to eruptions of solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  The mission has a design lifetime of three years and is planned to make observations up to the upcoming 2025 solar maximum. It also carries the name Xihe, for a solar deity from Chinese mythology, following a  public contest  to name the mission. The satellite is based on a new platform with its very high pointing accuracy and high stability reaching 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than existing domestic capabilities, according to the platform developer, the Shanghai Academy of Space Technology (SAST), a major CASC subsidiary.  The Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics (CIOMP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) was involved in the development of CHASE. The new platform makes the mission in part a technology verification test.  SAST  also provided the Long March 2D for the mission. China is planning to follow CHASE with the launch of the Advanced Space-born Solar Observatory (ASO-S) in 2022. China\u2019s next launch will be the Shenzhou-13 crewed mission to the Chinese space station core module, Tianhe, launching 12:23 Eastern Friday, October 15.  CASC is aiming to launch more than  40 times  in 2021, with commercial launch providers adding to this total. \u2014 Edited at 5:38 p.m. Eastern to include further details on payloads and involved parties, grid fins.",

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Italian ground segment provider Leaf Space announced plans Oct. 14 to add five ground stations to its global Leaf Line Network. Leaf Space is establishing ground stations in West and South Australia, British Columbia, Iceland and Bulgaria \u201cto satisfy the ever-growing customer demand we\u2019re experiencing right now, both in term of coverage (increasing our footprint worldwide) and of capacity (increasing the total number of contacts per satellite we can provide),\u201d Giovanni Pandolfi, Leaf Space co-founder and chief technology officer, told  SpaceNews  by email. \u201cThe locations have been selected according to these goals and always following the mid-latitude distributed network model that allows us to provide higher capacity with the same number of antennas to different kinds of Low Earth Orbits,\u201d like sun-synchronous, mid-inclination and equatorial orbit, \u201cwhile at the same time reducing the impact of interference and satellites overlapping,\u201d Pandolfi said. With the additional sites, Leaf Space will operate 15 ground stations. The company\u2019s new station in Iceland is designed to complement Leaf Space\u2019s existing Northern Scotland station in providing high-northern-latitude coverage. Stations in Bulgaria, Canada and Australia, meanwhile, are designed to provide options for mid-latitude communications, decreasing the risk of interference, band saturation and overlapping. Leaf Space is planning further expansion of its network in the first quarter of 2022 to ensure the company can help customers communicate with satellites in any low Earth orbit. \u201cDemand is definitely growing, we\u2019re now running at 10 times the capacity we had a year ago and forecasting to double again by the end of the year with both addition of these new ground stations supporting existing customers and new satellites to be launched in the upcoming months,\u201d Pandolfi said. \u201cRegarding type of customers, we\u2019re seeing an increase of adoption from remote sensing satellites, while at the same time the driving markets we already have (internet-of-things, in-space transportation) are also increasing in terms of the number of satellites and missions.\u201d",

    "title": "Astra to acquire spacecraft propulsion company Apollo Fusion",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/astra-to-acquire-spacecraft-propulsion-company-apollo-fusion/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Launch vehicle developer Astra is acquiring Apollo Fusion, a company developing electric propulsion systems for spacecraft, as part of its effort to create vertically integrated space systems. Astra is purchasing Apollo Fusion for $30 million in stock and $20 million in cash in a deal announced June 7. The deal includes an additional $95 million in earn-out incentives if Apollo Fusion reaches certain technical and revenue milestones. Astra will incorporate Apollo Fusion\u2019s Apollo Constellation Engine electric propulsion systems in satellite buses the company is developing to provide an integrated solution to customers. Astra revealed its satellite plans in February when  it announced it would merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Holicity . The companies said the acquisition will close after Astra completes its merger with Holicity later this year. In an interview, Chris Kemp, chief executive of Astra, said that Apollo Fusion\u2019s thrusters fill a technology gap for those future satellites. \u201cWhat this is about is adding a really core piece of technology to Astra\u2019s platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll unlock a whole new set of customer opportunities for us.\u201d \u201cThe next puzzle piece is the vertically integrated spacecraft. So, as we started to look at that, what are the core technologies that drive that?\u201d he said. \u201cThis engine is one of those key cornerstones of that space platform we\u2019re building.\u201d Mike Cassidy, chief executive of Apollo Fusion, said customers of both his company\u2019s thrusters and Astra\u2019s rockets were looking for an integrated solution. \u201cA lot of our customers were asking us for the total solution for getting from the ground from the orbit they want to go, and Chris\u2019s customers are asking the same thing,\u201d he said in an interview. Apollo Fusion,  which has sold its Apollo Constellation Engine to several customers, most recently York Space Systems , will continue to market the thruster to other companies. \u201cWe are financially motivated to do that part of the deal, and Astra has made very good incentives for us to keep doing that,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cMike has an incredible customer manifest and pipeline, and we want to continue to serve those customers,\u201d Kemp said of Apollo Fusion. \u201cWe\u2019re incorporating what they\u2019re [Apollo Fusion] doing into our product as quickly as we can.\u201d Both companies have emphasized plans for mass production of their systems. Astra has a goal of performing daily launches as soon as the middle of the decade, while Apollo Fusion has emphasized production partnerships that would allow it to manufacture its thrusters in large quantities. Cassidy said he expects to leverage Astra\u2019s projected launch cadence to speed up development and testing of new thrusters. \u201cThe way it is now, we have to wait 9 or 12 months to do a test launch,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the future, we\u2019ll be able to do a test launch in two or four months.\u201d Kemp said he saw a lot of similarities between the two companies, and having known Cassidy for several years, it was clear that a deal made sense. \u201cIt\u2019s really like we\u2019re sister companies and their technology was just a big missing piece of our overall platform,\u201d he said. Astra roadmap Astra\u2019s acquisition of Apollo Fusion is the latest in a series of developments for the company. It announced May 18 a contract with Planet to perform multiple launches of Planet\u2019s imaging satellites in 2022. Kemp said in the interview that Astra has more than 50 launches under contract, serving a mix of government and commercial customers, although Planet is the first customer it\u2019s publicly announced. \u201cPlanet is probably the pioneer in the small satellite space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more proud to have them as the first customer we could announce.\u201d Astra also disclosed that it has a roadmap to develop larger vehicles, with the goal of placing up to 500 kilograms into orbit. The company did not disclose technical details of that roadmap, or a schedule for producing those larger vehicles. Kemp said plans for various megaconstellations influenced that roadmap. \u201cWe want to converge with what these megaconstellation operators are designing and flying in 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about being the most responsive launch service provider and also being the best way for us to build our own platform.\u201d He described an iterative process for gradually scaling up the company\u2019s launch vehicles to achieve that 500-kilogram target. \u201cMy goal is to have as many iterations as possible, where the engineers can add these things incrementally,\u201d he said, gradually increasing performance instead of making a big jump from 50 to 500 kilograms.  Up next for Astra is beginning commercial launches. Kemp said the company\u2019s next launch, after a December 2020 flight that nearly reached orbit, is scheduled for this summer. Astra expects to begin monthly launches in the fourth quarter.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/chinese-official-denied-visa-to-attend-u-s-planetary-science-conference/",
    "content": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas \u2014 A leading official in China\u2019s lunar and Mars exploration program was reportedly denied a visa by the United States to attend a scientific conference here this week. Guobin Yu, vice director of the Lunar and Space Exploration Engineering Center of China, was scheduled to speak at a symposium here March 19 to discuss China\u2019s plans to explore the moon and Mars.  However, Jim Head, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University and organizer of the \u201cMicrosymposium 58\u201d meeting held before the start of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, said that he was informed by Yu just before the start of the event that the U.S. embassy in Beijing had denied his request for a visa to attend the conference. Head said that the denial came after Chinese government officials approved Yu\u2019s plans to speak at the conference \u201cApproval for this visit came from the highest levels of the Chinese space program and, in fact, from the Chinese government,\u201d he said. He said that he was unaware of the reason the U.S. government gave for denying a visa to Yu, of if any reason was provided at all. The embassy did not respond to a March 19 email seeking information about the denied visa. That denial did not extend to other Chinese scientists: Head said more than 20 people from Chinese universities, academies and scientific institutes were at the symposium.  As part of the Chinese government approval process, Head said that Yu was authorized to provide \u201cimportant\u201d updates about the China\u2019s plans to send missions to the moon and Mars, but he did not elaborate on the substance of those updates. Head, who has visited China to meet with Chinese scientists, offered his own overview of their exploration efforts. \u201cTheir program is extremely robust,\u201d he said, with the next major milestone being China\u2019s first lunar sample return mission, Chang\u2019e-5, scheduled for launch late this year. A second lunar sample return mission, Chang\u2019e-6, is planned for around 2020, according to Head. That may be followed by missions to the lunar polar regions in advance of human missions later in the 2020s or 2030s. China\u2019s first full-fledged Mars mission is scheduled for launch in 2020, flying both an orbiter and a lander, the latter equipped with a rover. Head said that China is also studying a Mars sample return mission for around 2030. The lunar exploration program in particular, which included two orbiter missions and one lander, has helped build interest in planetary science studies in China. \u201cThere\u2019s not historically been a major lunar and planetary science community in China, but in the last decade or so it\u2019s been growing,\u201d he said. Despite the visa denial and other obstacles to cooperation, such as provisions in NASA appropriations bills in recent years that restrict bilateral cooperation with China, Head said he was hopeful for greater cooperation in the future. He noted that he\u2019s worked with scientists in Russia and the former Soviet Union for 45 years, overcoming technology transfer and other obstacles even during the Cold War. \u201cThere\u2019s much to be gained from cooperation and collaboration in the scientific community,\u201d he said.

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/kymeta-expects-to-ship-its-first-flat-panel-antennas-in-may/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kymeta will finally start shipping its first flat-panel antennas this spring, some five years after Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates first opened his wallet to help the startup bring thin, lightweight, low-power antennas to a satellite market hungry for mobility solutions. The Redmond, Washington-based startup has raised $144 million since spinning off from Intellectual Ventures in 2012. Among customers awaiting Kymeta\u2019s May release of its flat, beam-steering antenna system are Panasonic, Toyota, and armored car company Aurum Security. Kymeta delayed its product release by about two years after discovering in 2015 that the rectangular antenna design it was working on at the time couldn\u2019t send and receive signals with a single aperture, but would need two, driving up size and cost. The rectangular design also couldn\u2019t leverage existing liquid crystal display manufacturing infrastructure, which would have made them more expensive to build, Bill Marks, chief commercial officer of Kymeta, told  SpaceNews . Kymeta teamed with electronics manufacturer Sharp Corp. in 2015 to mass produce its metamaterials-based antennas on the same product lines used to make LCD television sets. The circular design Kymeta chose instead rectified those issues, Marks said, and can reach downlink speeds greater than 100Mbps. Kymeta\u2019s antennas use electronic beam-steering instead of moving parts, and are considerably smaller than most mechanically steered antennas. Marks said the company chose to have two main products \u2014 the core \u201cmTenna\u201d subsystem module, and fully packaged \u201cKyWay\u201d terminals \u2014 to cater to markets that are familiar with satellite telecom and to design more products for markets where satellite is not present.  Global satellite fleet operator Intelsat of Luxembourg and the United States, and Sky Perfect JSAT in Japan revealed March 7 that they\u2019re investing in Kymeta, with Intelsat CEO Stephen Spengler joining Kymeta\u2019s board of directors and JSAT preparing a demonstration of Kymeta\u2019s antennas using its satellites.  Along with creating new opportunities in mobile connectivity, industry observers have also pointed out that low-cost, electronically steered antennas are likely a necessity for high-throughput non-geosynchronous constellations \u2014 especially in low-Earth orbit \u2014 where the satellites need to be tracked quickly as they cross the sky. O3b Networks, operator of a 12-satellite constellation in medium-Earth orbit, invested in Kymeta back in 2013. Marks said markets such as maritime and aviation have companies like Intellian and Cobham that have a larger market presence as terminal distributors. For those markets, Kymeta will lean on existing players to graft the mTenna into their products.  \u201cWhat we intend to do there is to sell antennas to them so that they can put their own flavor of a terminal wrapper around the antenna, and then they can sell it as part of their product suite,\u201d he said.  For other nascent markets like the connected car and other ground transportation, Marks said Kymeta will use KyWay to create terminals.  \u201cA good example is we have contracts with bus companies and train companies,\u201d he explained. \u201cNobody really builds a flat-panel satellite terminal today, so we are building our own to address those markets, because there is no clear channel to enter those markets.\u201d Panasonic since mid-2016 has been working with Kymeta on a version of its antenna optimised for maritime. Similarly, Inmarsat and Honeywell teamed with Kymeta in 2015 to produce aviation-focused antennas. The biggest opportunity, however, is the connected car, Marks said.  \u201cAll of maritime represents 25,000 VSAT terminals. Toyota alone is 10.5 million a year. Other deals end up larger than maritime very rapidly,\u201d he said.  Kymeta, Intelsat and Toyota are all partners on the connected car, and criss-crossed the continental U.S. in 2016 testing a Toyota 4Runner connected to Intelsat\u2019s fleet via a Kymeta mTenna. In February, Kymeta said it was able to connect a car and stream video using a 20-centimeter mTenna connected to Intelsat\u2019s satellite constellation. Marks said Toyota is a shareholder and customer of Kymeta, but declined to say how much of the company they own, or how many antennas they would buy. Intelsat, which has teamed with Kymeta for much of its product development, has created a bundling service called Kalo that lets mTenna and KyWay customers buy satellite services in a fashion more akin to the cellular industry.  \u201cInstead of buying bits per second or megahertz, you will buy bytes per month,\u201d Marks said.  Kymeta and Intelsat have that product slated for release in the third quarter of 2017. ",

    "content": "This story was updated March 28 to add a T\u00fcrksat statement on the status of its T\u00fcrksat 5A and 5B tenders. WARSAW, Poland \u2014 The Turkish parliament is deliberating on a draft bill to create a space agency  to boost the country\u2019s space industry and facilitate Ankara\u2019s expansion within the global space industry. The draft was recently debated by the parliament\u2019s Committee on Industry, Trade, Energy, Natural Resources, Information and Technology. Speaking to the committee March 2, Turkish Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications Minister Ahmet Arslan told lawmakers that the government aimed to launch the world\u2019s 39th space agency. The move would allow Turkey to reduce its dependence on foreign technology suppliers, according to the minister. \u201cWith T\u00fcrksat 5A and 5B, by increasing the share of the local, national supply [of components], we will manage to produce satellite parts in our country, and with T\u00fcrksat 6A, I hope we will produce it completely from the local, national supply [of components]. Owing to the Turkish Space Agency, we would like to become a country that not only produces and launches satellites, but also exports satellites,\u201d Arslan said, as quoted in a March 5 statement by the ministry. \u201cOf course, it is not enough to just produce satellites. It is very important for countries to have a capacity and ability to launch them.\u201d According to the minister, by establishing its national space agency, Turkey aims to join the \u201ctop league\u201d of 10 to 12 countries that have their own satellite-launching capabilities. \u201cWe hope to become a country that has the capacity to launch [satellites into space],\u201dArslan said. By 2023, Turkey is also planning to reach a $5 billion share of the global space industry, Arslan said, as quoted by the state-run broadcaster TRT. Ankara attempted to launch its first communications satellite in 1994 with  the ill-fated launch of the T\u00fcrksat 1A on the Ariane 4 rocket at the European Space Agency\u2019s Guiana Space Center. Arslan said last August  in a statement published on T\u00fcrksat\u2019s website  that T\u00fcrksat 5A and 5B would launch in 2018 and 2019, respectively. However, the company said March 28 that it hasn\u2019t made final decisions on who will build and launch the satellites, or when they will be launched. \u201cWe have received the Best and Final Offers (BAFO) and have come to the final stages of the bidding process regarding the T\u00fcrksat 5A and T\u00fcrksat 5B satellite projects,\u201d T\u00fcrksat spokeswoman Meltem Kutbay said in a March 28 statement.  \u201cFor the manufacturing of the satellites, we have received offers from leading international companies. The evaluation period for the projects are ongoing, as for launch services no firm has been decided on. Due to this no date has been set for the launch.\u201d The state-owned satellite operator T\u00fcrksat has said that the projected domestic manufacturing contribution to the 5A satellite will represent some 25 percent. The 6A is expected to be launched in 2020. The legislation states that establishing a space industry is part of Ankara\u2019s broader economic development objectives. \u201cAs a response to the needs of the space and aircraft industry, we will establish the Turkish Space Agency to contribute to the goal of making [Turkey] one of the world\u2019s ten largest economies by 2023,\u201d the draft bill says. Under the draft bill, the new agency is to be established as an entity that will be supervised by the Turkish Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Given the comfortable majority that the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) holds in the country\u2019s parliament, with 317 members  out of the 549 seats that are currently taken, it is most likely that the draft bill will be passed by the parliament without excessive delay.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/oneweb-breaks-ground-on-a-florida-factory-that-will-build-thousands-of-satellites/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 OneWeb Satellites, the joint venture between rising satellite operator OneWeb and manufacturing giant Airbus, broke ground March 16 on a dedicated factory that will build thousands of OneWeb satellites instead of the hundreds originally envisioned. OneWeb Satellites Chief Executive Brian Holz said the $85 million Exploration Park, Florida, facility \u2014 which is scheduled to open a year from now \u2014 will go above and beyond the initial 900-satellite contract OneWeb placed in January last year.  \u201cWe\u2019ll produce over 2,000 satellites largely to be flown in LEO, low-Earth orbit, to be a key kingpin in that architecture,\u201d Holz said during the ceremony. \u201cThat\u2019s going to allow us the foundation, with new automation techniques, to lower the cost of satellite delivery, and also shorten the schedules for our customer and create value that is not in the industry today.\u201d OneWeb Founder Greg Wyler tipped his hand regarding OneWeb\u2019s bigger constellation plan in February, telling an audience in London and later affirming to  SpaceNews  that the company was  actively weighing about 2,000 satellites  on top of the initially announced 648. Since then, OneWeb has described its initial \u201cgen-1\u201d constellation as 882 satellites, and filed with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for permission to serve the U.S. market with 2,000 more satellites split between LEO and medium-Earth orbit.  OneWeb Satellites claims the Florida factory  will be able to produce up to three satellites per day. In a March 16 interview with  SpaceNews , Mike Cosentino, president of Airbus Defense and Space Inc., expressed confidence that the joint venture will be able to meet this production rate.  \u201cOnce we have the manufacturing processes down, once we have the suppliers lined up and the schedule validated, then we will operate in the same fashion as any high-assembly product does. It hasn\u2019t happened with a satellite, but there is no reason we can\u2019t do it with a satellite if you do it with airplanes and automobiles,\u201d he said. The first 10 satellites for the overall constellation are planned for construction at an Airbus facility in Toulouse, France. Cosentino said reaching the three-a-day production rate is just as much about the design of the satellites as it is the factory. OneWeb Satellites will validate the production methods in Toulouse and replicate the process in Florida. Each spacecraft will be about the size of a washing machine, he said.  OneWeb Satellites\u2019 Florida factory, like Blue Origin\u2019s launcher factory, is being built just outside the gates of NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center. In a March 16 statement, Wyler said the facility will enable OneWeb \u201cto continuously iterate on the design of our satellites, launch new satellites within hours of completion and create significant opportunity in the U.S.\u201d  Most of OneWeb\u2019s spacecraft are contracted to launch on Arianespace-provided Europeanized Soyuz rockets, but some will launch on two rockets still in development: Virgin Orbit\u2019s LauncherOne air-launch system and Blue Origin\u2019s reusable New Glenn rocket.  OneWeb Satellites\u2019 main customer is OneWeb, but the company is not exclusively bound to build satellites for OneWeb alone. The company said it could be ready to build satellites for commercial and government customers in 2018. OneWeb\u2019s first-generation constellation is expected to start launches that year.  Not including subcontractors, OneWeb Satellites anticipates the Florida factory will create around 250 new jobs, bringing employment opportunities to a region still feeling the effects of the 2011 shutdown of NASA space shuttle program. The company expects to create thousands of more jobs \u2014 though not all in Florida \u2014 through its supplier base. Many of those suppliers are likely to set up locations of their own in Florida to keep pace with OneWeb Satellites\u2019 demand. Holz said component manufacturer Ruag Space, based in Switzerland, is bringing about 50 jobs to Florida related to OneWeb.  Holz said OneWeb Satellites will provide connectivity to a school in Brevard County, Florida, linking the academic institution with another school in Toulouse as a recognition of the company\u2019s vision of connecting 2 million schools around the world. Once OneWeb\u2019s own satellites are in orbit, he said the connection would switch to using that system.  OneWeb has the goal of bridging the digital divide by 2025, and has affirmed that goal has not changed with its  pending merger  with global geostationary satellite operator Intelsat. ",

The blueprint proposes cancelling ARM and four Earth science missions, and also shutting down NASA\u2019s Office of Education. The budget proposal would provide additional funding for NASA\u2019s planetary science program, but would not allocate any money to a proposed Europa lander mission.

    "title": "White House budget proposal targets ARM, Earth science missions, education",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/white-house-budget-proposal-targets-arm-earth-science-missions-education/",
    "content": "Updated 4:00 p.m. Eastern. WASHINGTON \u2014 A fiscal year 2018 budget proposal released by the Trump administration March 16 would cancel NASA\u2019s Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) and several Earth science programs, but spares NASA the deeper cuts proposed for many other agencies. The budget blueprint document, an outline of the administration\u2019s budget request but with only limited details, requests $19.1 billion for NASA, a cut of about one percent from the $19.285 billion the agency received in fiscal year 2016. NASA, like other government agencies, is currently operating under a continuing resolution that funds programs at 2016 levels. Targeted for cancellation in the budget proposal is ARM, a NASA program to fly a robotic spacecraft to a near Earth object, retrieve a boulder from its surface and fly back to lunar orbit, where astronauts would visit it on a future Orion mission. ARM has enjoyed lukewarm support, at best, in Congress, with many members expressing opposition to a mission they claim does not support long-term exploration goals. The budget document does not provide details about the reason for cancelling ARM beyond to \u201caccommodate increasing development costs\u201d in exploration programs. The document said that the Space Launch System, Orion and associated ground systems would get $3.7 billion in 2018, an amount similar to what those programs collectively received in 2016. In a March 16 statement, NASA Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot confirmed that ARM itself would not survive under the administration\u2019s proposal, but that some of its key technologies, such as the solar electric propulsion system that would have been used by the robotic spacecraft to travel to and from the asteroid, may live on in NASA\u2019s overall exploration efforts.  \u201cWe will continue the solar electric propulsion efforts benefitting from those developments for future in space transportation initiatives,\u201d he said. \u201cI have had personal involvement with this team and their progress for the past few years, and am I extremely proud of their efforts to advance this mission.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how plans to cancel ARM in the 2018 budget proposal would affect ongoing activities, including the selection of a contractor to provide the bus for the mission\u2019s robotic spacecraft. NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said March 16 that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to draw any conclusions about the fate of those efforts, adding that technology development activities, as well as funding for near Earth asteroid searches, will continue should ARM itself end. Earth science cuts, planetary science increases The budget proposal provides $1.8 billion for Earth science programs, a cut of about five percent from what NASA received in 2016. It specifically targets four planned or ongoing missions for termination: the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite, the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) Pathfinder and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) 3 instruments for the International Space Station, and \u201cDSCOVR Earth-viewing instruments,\u201d an apparent reference to Earth observation instruments on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), launched in 2015. The blueprint didn\u2019t explain why these missions were targeted for elimination. In NASA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget request, it projected spending in fiscal year 2018 $27.9 million on CLARREO Pathfinder, $9.5 million on OCO-3 and $1.2 million on DSCOVR. No budget was provided for PACE, a mission still in early phases of development and not planned for launch until the early 2020s. The blueprint noted additional cost reductions would come from cuts in research grant programs. One area getting a budget increase is NASA\u2019s planetary science program, which would receive $1.9 billion in the administration\u2019s request, up from $1.63 billion in 2016. The document specifically mentions support for the Mars 2020 rover mission and the Europa Clipper mission. However, the budget proposal provides no funding for a proposed Europa lander mission, still in concept development, in order to \u201cpreserve the balance of NASA\u2019s science portfolio and maintain flexibility to conduct missions that were determined to be more important by the science community.\u201d Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, alluded to the lack of funding for a Europa lander mission in a briefing with reporters March 15. \u201cI think we changed one of the missions to a moon at Saturn or Jupiter, but I can\u2019t remember the details on that,\u201d he said. Europa is a moon of Jupiter. \u201cWe remain committed to studying our home planet and the universe, but are reshaping our focus within the resources available to us \u2013 a budget not far from where we have been in recent years, and which enables our wide ranging science work on many fronts,\u201d Lightfoot said in his statement. Education cuts and other changes The budget proposal also seeks to eliminate NASA\u2019s Office of Education, which received $115 million in 2016. \u201cThe Office of Education has experienced significant challenges in implementing a NASA-wide education strategy and is performing functions that are duplicative of other parts of the agency,\u201d the document stated. An October 2015 report by the NASA Office of Inspector General concluded that the Office of Education\u2019s programs risked being ineffective because of a lack of internal collaboration to identify joint efforts. \u201cNASA risks funding a fragmented portfolio of activities,\u201d the report warned. Lightfoot, in his statement, said the cut would not affect agency outreach. \u201cNASA will continue to inspire the next generation through our missions and channel education efforts in a more focused way through the robust portfolio of our Science Mission Directorate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will also continue to use every opportunity to support the next generation through engagement in our missions and the many ways that our work encourages the public to discover more.\u201d The cut, if enacted, would presumably affect a number of other education programs that account for the bulk of the office\u2019s spending. They include the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research and Minority University Research Education Project. In space technology, the budget proposal \u201crestructures\u201d RESTORE-L, a satellite servicing program that received $133 million in fiscal year 2016. The administration called RESTORE-L \u201cduplicative\u201d and said that restructuring would \u201creduce its cost and better position it to support a nascent commercial satellite servicing industry,\u201d saving $88 million over 2016 levels. RESTORE-L is intended to demonstrate satellite servicing in low Earth orbit, including refueling of the Landsat-7 satellite, with a launch planned in 2020. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is working on a separate satellite servicing effort, called Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites, intended to work with satellite in geostationary orbit. The proposal provided few other fiscal details about the budget proposal, including a breakout of spending by budgetary account with NASA. The blueprint document said that its proposal \u201ccreates new opportunities for collaboration with industry\u201d on a variety of programs, from International Space Station operations to data purchase programs for companies operating small satellite constellations, but offered no specifics about those initiatives. Although the language lacked specifics, the general theme of greater public-private cooperation received the endorsement of one industry group. \u201cIn an era of constrained budgets and fiscal realities, the commercial space industry stands ready to support the president\u2019s agenda of achieving great things in space, leveraging commercial approaches and the rapid results that come with them,\u201d said Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, in a statement. Big picture Despite the cut to some NASA programs, the overall effect on the agency is relatively minor compared to others. The budget proposal makes much deeper cuts at other agencies, including a 31 percent reduction at the Environmental Protection Agency and 28 percent cut at the State Department. The Commerce Department, which includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, would see its overall budget cut by 16 percent in the proposal. The document doesn\u2019t provide specific figures for NOAA, but states that the budget \u201cmaintains the development\u201d of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) weather satellite programs. However, the budget would take savings from the Polar Follow On program, which funds development of future JPSS satellites after JPSS-2, \u201cby better reflecting the actual risk of a gap in polar satellite coverage.\u201d While the document offered no additional details, that statement is widely believed to mean stretching out the schedule of future JPSS spacecraft to save money in the near future. NASA, Mulvaney suggested at the briefing, was a priority for the Trump administration and thus spared the deeper cuts other agencies received. \u201cSpace exploration is part of his priorities,\u201d he said of the president. \u201cThis is a positive budget overall for NASA,\u201d Lightfoot said, while acknowledging that the agency has \u201cgreater aspirations than we have means\u201d provided in the proposal. \u201cI want to reiterate that we are committed to NASA\u2019s core mission of exploration \u2013 in all the ways we carry that out.\u201d A full budget proposal, with spending details for all federal programs, will be released by early May.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/asiasat-says-booming-regional-economies-outweigh-oversupply-fears/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Regional satellite operator AsiaSat of Hong Kong expects the high growth rates of several Asian economies will outlast the current oversupply of satellite capacity and will reinforce the operator\u2019s business case in an increasingly crowded market.  AsiaSat reported 2016 revenue of 1.27 billion Hong Kong dollars ($163.73 million), a 3-percent decrease the company said was due to the conclusion of a short-term contract on AsiaSat-3S, which is in an inclined orbit. Were it not for the end of that contract, annual revenue would have instead grown by about 3 percent, the operator said in an earnings statement released March 15.  \u201cWith regional economic prospects as estimated by the [International Monetary Fund], World Bank and [Economist Intelligence Unit] that range from 6.8% [gross domestic product] growth for China in 2017, 7.3% for India and forecasts that hover around 6% for the majority of South and Southeast Asia (with Myanmar outstanding at 8.5%), as an innovative service provider AsiaSat has a positive commercial outlook despite the short-term negatives such as the current capacity over-supply.\u201d As in earnings statements from previous years, AsiaSat reported pressure from oversupply as more than a dozen regional operators \u2014 not to mention global operators \u2014 field telecom satellites for Asia and the Pacific. AsiaSat Chairman Ju Wei Min reiterated the challenges associated with competing in a crowded market of both private and state-owned operators.  \u201cThe market instability resulted from a global oversupply of satellite capacity of all kinds and generally uncertain economic conditions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe recognise the need to continue to manage closely the pricing pressures on data services as well as compression improvements for video distribution which to some extent neutralise the benefits of the increased demand generated by mobility applications and video format upgrades.\u201d Ju described AsiaSat\u2019s nearly flat revenue for 2016 as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but cautioned that the company\u2019s financial performance \u201cshould be viewed against a backdrop of globally unstable market conditions and the impact of disruptive new technologies.\u201d AsiaSat tallied 99 transponders used across its core fleet of four satellites \u2014 AsiaSat 4, AsiaSat 5, AsiaSat 6 and AsiaSat 7 \u2014 during 2016, an increase of three transponders and totalling a 67-percent average fill rate. The operator did not count AsiaSat-8, which is on loan to Israeli-satellite operator Spacecom for $22 million a year, in its fill rate, saying that the satellite now \u201cno longer serves AsiaSat customers directly.\u201d Spacecom is only using AsiaSat-8\u2019s Ku-band payload (ignoring the Ka-band payload) but still rebranded the satellite as Amos-7 after relocating it to 4 degrees west. AsiaSat says the ageing AsiaSat 3S satellite at 146 degrees east still has the means to provide services to customers for short-term contracts from its inclined orbit before being retired. AsiaSat said that AsiaSat-9, a replacement satellite for AsiaSat-4 under construction by Space Systems Loral in Palo Alto, California, is scheduled to launch late this year. AsiaSat-9 introduces a Ka-band high-throughput payload to the mix along with replacing AsiaSat-4\u2019s C- and Ku-band capacity.  Ju said AsiaSat will \u201ccontinue to evaluate opportunities to develop its HTS Ka-band capabilities\u201d while monitoring and pursuing new business opportunities in ultra-HD broadcasts and Internet of Things connectivity services. He said AsiaSat is also pursuing more business opportunities with niche direct-to-home broadcast platforms focused on smaller emerging markets that often need local-language services. Profits for 2016 attributable to owners decreased by $1.29 million because of lower revenue and higher depreciation charges. AsiaSat said it is continuing to invest in streamlining its sales structure and to invest in new telecommunications infrastructure where needed.  AsiaSat reported new and renewed contracts worth $240.72 million for 2016, and contracts on hand up 16 percent year over year to $523.54 million.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/spacedatahighway-to-add-third-node-for-global-coverage/",
    "content": "LONDON \u2014 Airbus will add a third node to the European Data Relay System (EDRS) constellation of satellites that use laser links to download live imagery from Earth-observation satellites and provide military communications that are virtually impossible to intercept. The third node, EDRS-D, to be positioned in geostationary orbit above the Asia Pacific region in 2020 or 2021, will expand the constellation\u2019s coverage to near global with some residual blind spots to remain over North America and the northern Pacific Ocean. The advanced laser telecommunication terminal to be developed by Airbus\u2019 subsidiary Tesat Spacecom will for the first time allow transmitting data between geostationary satellites via laser links. The two EDRS payloads in orbit today lack the ability to talk directly to each other. \u201cWith EDRS-D, we will be able to retrieve data, for example, from a Sentinel satellite over Australia and backbone it via EDRS-D to EDRS-A and downlink it in Europe,\u201d said Hughes Boulnois, who heads the EDRS project at Airbus. Dubbed the SpaceDataHighway, or the optical fiber in the sky, EDRS can transmit up to 40 terabytes of data per day in near-real-time at a data rate of 1.8 Gbps \u2014 almost three times higher than the U.S. Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, which relies on Ku- and Ka-bands. The first node of the constellation, EDRS-A, is hosted on Eutelsat-9B spacecraft in geostationary orbit at 9 degrees east. Launched in January 2016, the laser terminal started commercial operations in November, servicing the European Commission\u2019s Sentinel-1A Earth-observation satellite, part of the Copernicus program.  OHB SE of Bremen, Germany, is building the second EDRS satellite, EDRS-C, with a launch expected by the end of this year. \u201cThe European Commission is very happy about the performance of the service,\u201d said Boulnois. \u201cWe have demonstrated that we can deliver up to 50 percent more data from Sentinel-1A than what is possible with the X-band channel.\u201d EDRS-C, to be positioned at 31 east, will provide redundancy over Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and extend the constellation\u2019s coverage out to Singapore. Unlike EDRS-A, EDRS-C will be a dedicated satellite operated by Airbus hosting an additional payload from Avanti, the U.K.-based telecoms provider. Airbus is currently looking for a partner to host the newly announced Asia-Pacific EDRS-D node. \u201cAirbus is not such a strong player in Asia Pacific so we need a partner that would allow us to expand our reach,\u201d Boulnois said. \u201cAlso, from the economical perspective it makes more sense to combine forces with an operator, bringing the EDRS capability and identifying strong synergies with their telecom mission.\u201d Airbus expects EDRS-D will bring about a step change in EDRS services. Both, EDRS-A and EDRS-C only have one laser communications terminal. For EDRS-D, Airbus plans at least three terminals, which will enable the node to serve multiple customers at the same time.  In addition to downlinking data from low-Earth-orbiting satellites, Airbus is also eyeing the military aviation and unmanned aerial vehicle communications market in the Asia Pacific region. \u201cThis area, from the security perspective, has some challenges and we can see that our customers are asking for more resilience, more secure communication,\u201d Boulnois said. \u201cWe are currently performing demonstrations and in-flight tests with our A310 [Multi Role Tanker Transport] platform to demonstrate air-to-geostationary connectivity via laser links, and we know already that customers are really interested in the key features of this technology,\u201d he said. Those key features, Boulnois said, are low probability of intercept, low probability of detection, high bandwidth and \u201cthe fact that you cannot jam it.\u201d Boulnois hinted Airbus is already pondering a fourth node to cover North America.  The EDRS constellation, a public-private partnership between Airbus and the European Space Agency, is currently serving only one customer \u2013 the European Commission\u2019s Copernicus Earth-observation program. The laser links enable data from the low-Earth-orbiting satellites to be accessed immediately upon acquisition, eliminating the waiting for the satellite to fly over its ground station. The four Sentinel satellites in orbit \u2014 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B \u2014 all have laser communications terminals capable of using the SpaceDataHighway.  ",

The company lacked the high-profile presence in years past at the satellite industry conference, including skipping a panel of satellite operator chief executives, because of company decisions to focus resources on events where it can better connect with potential customers. \u201cWe have to make huge, enormous efforts to go deep into the markets in which we operate,\u201d a company spokesman said. [SpaceNews] Russia\u2019s space agency is starting the search for new cosmonauts that it says could one day fly to the moon.  Roscosmos announced the new cosmonaut recruitment drive  Tuesday , saying it\u2019s looking to hire six to eight cosmonauts that would fly a new crew vehicle, Federation, under development. Those missions, Roscosmos added, would include flights to the moon. Russian government plans for its human spaceflight program have proposed lunar missions, although none are expected before the late 2020s. [AFP] A Spanish company has successfully conducted the first test of its balloon-borne rocket . Zero 2 Infinity said that, in a March 1 test, the company lofted a Bloostar rocket to an altitude of 25 kilometers on a balloon; the rocket then released and fired its engine for a few seconds, as planned. The test was intended to demonstrate the rocket\u2019s telemetry systems, and is part of a broader program to demonstrate Bloostar\u2019s ability to launch small satellites. [SpaceNews] The Canadian government is providing funding to support UrtheCast\u2019s imaging satellite system.  The Ministry of Innovation, Science and Economic Development said  Tuesday  it was providing $13.1 million to UrtheCast as part of the government\u2019s Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative. The money will help develop UrtheCast\u2019s OptiSAR constellation of optical and radar imaging satellites. The funding will be provided by the government in quarterly installments over the next four years, and must be repaid over a 15-year period starting in 2023. [UrtheCast] Weather is looking favorable for  Friday  night\u2019s Delta 4 launch of a military communications satellite.  An initial forecast for the launch, scheduled for  7:44 p.m.  Eastern from Cape Canaveral, Florida, calls for a 90-percent chance of acceptable weather at launch. The launch of the ninth Wideband Global Satcom satellite was scheduled for earlier this month but delayed because of a booster issue. [Spaceflight Now] House members are seeking less restrictive regulation of commercial space activities.  At a recent hearing of the House space subcommittee, leading members said they opposed a proposal made last year by the Obama administration to create a \u201cmission authorization\u201d system to provide oversight of commercial space activities not covered by existing licensing systems. Some witnesses at the hearing argued that the language in the Outer Space Treaty requiring such oversight to perform \u201cauthorization and continuing supervision\u201d had been misinterpreted, but others said some degree of regulation is needed to ensure safe space operations. [SpaceNews] A site in Nova Scotia could potential host launches of a Ukrainian rocket.  Martime Launch Services, a Canadian company founded by three Americans, said  Tuesday  it selected a location near the town of Canso, Nova Scotia, on the Atlantic coast, as its launch site for Cyclone-4 rockets. The company would have to build the launch site and also raise the funding needed for the site and the overall venture. The company claims it could launch as many as eight rockets a year by 2022.

    "title": "Firefly Space Systems assets to be sold",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/firefly-space-systems-assets-to-be-sold/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The assets of Firefly Space Systems, a company that was developing a small launch vehicle before encountering financial problems last year, will be sold this week in an auction organized by a little-known company backed by a Ukrainian entrepreneur. An undated  public notice  states that \u201cvirtually all\u201d of the assets of Firefly Space Systems will be sold at a public auction scheduled for March 16 in Menlo Park, California. Those assets include the company\u2019s physical assets as well as \u201cgeneral intangibles\u201d that include patents and other intellectual property. The auction was announced by EOS Launcher, Inc., a company described in the announcement as the secured party in a loan agreement with Firefly dated Oct. 20. That agreement, whose specifics are not described in the notice, is dated three weeks after Firefly announced  it was furloughing its staff because of financial problems stemming from an investment that fell through . Thomas Markusic, co-founder and chief executive of Firefly, said in an October interview that the company was looking to raise short-term capital at the time to keep the company running for four months while considering its options. Those options, he said then, could include a sale of the company. The public notice states that prospective bidders must provide a $100,000 deposit and also deposit funds for their proposed maximum bid into an account 24 hours before the auction. EOS Launcher, though, reserved the right to bid without making an advance deposit. EOS Launcher is a company incorporated in Delaware on Jan. 27, according to filings with the state\u2019s Division of Corporations. The company registered with California\u2019s Secretary of State on Feb. 21, giving a mailing address in Menlo Park that is the same as the location of the auction mentioned in the public notice. The president of EOS Launcher, according to the public notice, is Maxym Polyakov. In his profile on the social networking site LinkedIn, Polyakov identified himself as founder and chief executive of \u201cPrivate Space Projects\u201d since January 2016. \u201cIn the early 2016 I\u2019ve launched a project called Earth Observing System (EOS),\u201d his description of Private Space Projects reads. The company, he said, intends to provide \u201cthe full circle of space-related services\u201d including launch vehicles, spacecraft, ground stations and \u201cproprietary satellite data, processed through our unique analytical engine.\u201d \u201cBy 2017, EOS will be listening to the \u2018social and commercial pulse of mankind on the planet,\u2019\u201d the description states. That effort appears to include EOS Data Analytics, a company that offers a platform for large-scale processing of Earth imaging data. Polyakov, who has a doctorate in international economics from the Dnepropetrovsk National University in Ukraine, has been involved in a number of other companies outside of the space field. Those companies range from an advertising technology company, Hitdynamics, to online dating company Cupid. He is also a managing partner at Noosphere Ventures, a fund that has invested in EOS Data Analytics and Aquila Space, a remote sensing smallsat company now part of Astro Digital. Polyakov did not respond to a request for comment in an email to the address provided in the public notice. Bruce Fryer, a spokesman for Firefly Space Systems, also did not respond to a request for comment. The Firefly web site makes no mention of the impending asset sale. Firefly was one of many companies that, in recent years, announced plans to develop small launch vehicles to serve the growing smallsat market. It was developing a rocket called the Alpha capable of placing up to 200 kilograms into sun-synchronous orbit for several million dollars. In a November statement, the company said that it had letters of intent from potential customers seeking 42 launches through 2021, which the company valued at more than $300 million. The only launch contract Firefly had announced, though, was an award from NASA\u2019s Venture Class Launch Services program in October 2015, for one launch at a price of $5.5 million. Firefly had raised about $70 million through a combination of equity, grants and debt, co-founder Michael Blum said at a conference last summer. That included $1 million provided by Space Florida, the state\u2019s space development agency, in a June 2015 secured convertible promissory note disclosed in the public notice. That note was subsequently acquired by EOS Launcher from Space Florida. Dale Ketcham, chief of strategic alliances at Space Florida, confirmed in a March 14 interview that Space Florida provided $1 million to Firefly as an incentive for launching from Cape Canaveral. He said that, after Firefly encountered financial problems, EOS Launcher approached the agency and agreed to buy the promissory note at face value. Ketcham predicted there would be more sales and mergers of companies as entrepreneurial sectors of the space industry mature. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes messy, but in the long run is a very healthy development,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "House committee weighs lighter touch to commercial space regulations",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/house-committee-weighs-lighter-touch-to-commercial-space-regulations/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Members of the House space subcommittee say they want to take a limited approach to regulating new commercial activities in space, rejecting the conclusions of a report by the Obama administration last year that called for something closer to a licensing approach. At a March 8 hearing of the subcommittee, members and witnesses grappled with the issue of how the government should oversee emerging commercial space activities in order to comply with obligations to the Outer Space Treaty, including whether such oversight is, in fact, required. Such \u201cauthorization and continuing supervision,\u201d as specified in Article 6 of the treaty, is handled today by various agencies for commercial communications and remote sensing satellites and for launch. It\u2019s less clear who would regulate new activities, ranging from commercial lunar landers to satellite servicing efforts, creating uncertainty in industry about who, if anyone, could provide that authorization and continuing supervision. An April 2016 report delivered to Congress by the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy, required by Section 108 of the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015, recommended what it called a \u201cmission authorization\u201d approach for providing that oversight. This approach would be modeled on the payload reviews performed by the Federal Aviation Administration during the launch licensing process, including an interagency review of proposed missions. While the mission authorization concept had won support from many in industry, as well as the FAA and some members of Congress, a change of administrations and its approach to regulation has emboldened some who want to limit industry regulation. \u201cUnfortunately, the Obama administration issued a report last year that called for expansive regulations over all types of private space activities,\u201d said Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Science Committee, at the hearing. He cited a \u201ccrisis of overregulation\u201d in general as a reason to oppose the previous administration\u2019s proposal. \u201cThe public debate has shifted in the last few weeks,\u201d he continued. \u201cInstead of presuming that expansive new agency regulatory powers are needed, the conversation is shifting to how to minimize agency regulation and avoid it all together.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate on that public debate, although President Trump signed an executive order Jan. 30 requiring agencies to propose eliminating at least two existing regulations for each new regulation it proposes. \u201cI have serious reservations with the Section 108 legislative proposal. While it may be well-intentioned, it is ill-conceived,\u201d said Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas), chairman of the space subcommittee. Babin has previously suggested his opposition to the mission authorization and related concepts, questioning whether they are needed. \u201cWe must not just presume that a traditional agency licensing authority, granted to the Department of Transportation, is the best way forward.\u201d Some witnesses agreed, saying the mission authorization and similar approaches were overly burdensome on companies and gave the government too much ability to reject companies\u2019 plans. \u201cThis framework is unnecessary to meet our international treaty obligations. It is also exceedingly impractical and disruptive,\u201d said Eli Dourado of George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. Laura Montgomery, a lawyer who previously worked at the FAA on commercial space regulatory issues, argued that the Outer Space Treaty\u2019s language regarding authorization and continuing supervision has been misinterpreted. \u201cMany claim that Article 6 prohibits commercial operations in outer space unless the government authorizes and supervises\u201d those activities, she said. That treaty language, she said, is not \u201cself-executing,\u201d which means it does not create an obligation for companies unless Congress acts. She argued that the proposal offered by the Obama administration was overly broad. \u201cIf Article 6 truly meant that all activities had to be overseen, where would oversight stop?\u201d she asked, suggesting it would require oversight of all activities, even those not regulated on Earth. Other witnesses, and some members of the committee, argued that some degree of regulation of activities was needed to ensure safe operations in space. \u201cThe largest single threat to a thriving commercial space market we all seek to foster is the potential for lapses in spaceflight safety which would seriously damage the entire commercial space industry,\u201d said Doug Loverro, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, referring to concerns about collisions and the creation of orbital debris. \u201cThe laissez-faire approach to spaceflight safety has serious and non-quantifiable impacts.\u201d \u201cI think there\u2019s some really good reasons for having some form of authorization and supervision,\u201d said Dennis Burnett, adjunct professor of law at the University of Nebraska\u2019s College of Law. That would, he said, provide some regulatory certainty for companies and for encouraging other nations to take similar approaches. Burnett, though, was critical of interagency deliberations, as proposed in the mission authorization concept. \u201cSome of the decision criteria used are black boxes,\u201d he said, making it difficult for companies to figure out how they can comply. \u201cIn almost any other circumstance, such a process would be considered to be both arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), who has previously proposed an \u201cenhanced payload review\u201d process similar to mission authorization, suggested some activities, like satellite servicing, required more regulation than asteroid mining because of the perceived military applications that would draw the attention of the State and Defense Departments. \u201cWe have to have a mechanism to initiate the interagency process that ultimately results in an authorization,\u201d he said.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/why-ses-all-but-skipped-satellite-2017/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Satellite 2017 visitors were surprised to see Kymeta Corp.\u2019s booth in the prominent exhibit hall location traditionally reserved for global satellite fleet operator SES. That change prompted rumors and speculation on why SES did not have its usual high-profile presence at the annual satellite trade show, which took place here March 6-9. \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a bit of scuttlebutt,\u201d said an industry executive who asked not to be identified. SES is only too happy to clear up any confusion. The elephant not in the room \n \u201cIn our reflection of what we have to do this year, our priorities, what is missing, and where we therefore have to invest, having a booth on that show and having a seat on the elephant panel, these things were not priorities,\u201d SES spokesman Markus Payer told  SpaceNews. \u201c When you look at what you spend compared to what you get, we had to set priorities.\u201d The \u201celephant panel\u201d refers to the conference\u2019s high-visibility session featuring global satellite fleet operator chief executives. The CEOs of Intelsat, Eutelsat, Inmarsat, Telesat and ViaSat were all there. The CEO of SES, which tied Intelsat as the world\u2019s biggest satellite operator with $2.188 billion in revenue last year, was not. Luxembourg-based SES maintains a presence in the metropolitan Washington area throughout the year. The firm has a large Washington office and the firm offers satellite communications services to U.S. government agencies through its subsidiary SES Government Solutions of Reston, Virginia. Top SES executives did attend the Satellite 2017 conference, including Ferdinand Kayser, chief commercial officer, Christophe De Hauwer, chief development officer, and Steve Collar, chairman of O3B Networks, which SES purchased in 2016. Pete Hoene, SES Government Solutions president and chief executive, also attended the conference. \u201cWhat we changed was the [SES] presence on the representative part of the show itself,\u201d Payer said. \u201cThe expense and the energy it costs is a significant amount at the end of the day. It\u2019s packages, it\u2019s sponsoring, it\u2019s material and film you need to produce. At the end, you make the calculation and say, \u2018Is that what we want to spend for what we get.\u2019\u201d Before SES executives decide to attend conferences or trade shows, they look at the firm\u2019s internal statistics on the number of customer leads those events have generated in the past. Those calculations may prompt SES executives to attend the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona or European Commission events in Brussels, Payer said. \u201cOne thing is very clear: The times are over where we would sit in the satellite sector and say, \u2018We have these nice things and one day people will call and contract capacity,\u2019\u201d Payer said. \u201cWe have to make huge, enormous efforts to go deep into the markets in which we operate.\u201d \u201cSatellite innovation does not make sense if we don\u2019t feel the pulse of those people who could actually be interested in that capacity,\u201d Payer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not about capacity only. Customers want systems, architectures, end-to-end solutions. If you don\u2019t understand deeply what these people not only want today but will want, you are not evolving your products.\u201d Like its parent company, SES Government Solutions played a smaller role in this year\u2019s satellite conference than it has in previous years. In 2017, SES Government Solutions executives are attending events that focus entirely on the firm\u2019s U.S. government customers, said spokeswoman Natalia Kossobokova. \u201cFor example, during Satellite 2017, we were the exclusive underwriter for a  Defense One  event titled \u2018Space and Satellites in the New Administration,\u2019\u201d Kossobokova said by email. That event, held at the Long View art gallery near the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, which housed Satellite 2017, \u201cafforded SES Government Solutions an opportunity to learn from, and connect with our U.S. Government counterparts during the week of the conference.\u201d SES Government Solutions also met with customers in a meeting room the firm reserved at the nearby Renaissance Washington, D.C. Downtown Hotel. Payer and Kossobokova said it\u2019s too soon to say what role SES will play in next year\u2019s trade show. \u201cWe will make our decision for next year later in the year,\u201d Payer said. Kymeta executives, for their part, were pleased with the noteworthy location of their Satellite 2017 booth. The firm has exhibited at the satellite trade show for approximately five years but its 2017 booth was twice as large as its previous booths, said a Kymeta executive. \u201cWe had a big announcement this week and we wanted to celebrate,\u201d she said. On March 7, Kymeta announced a partnership with Intelsat to offer a commercial broadband service, called K\u0100LO, that pairs Kymeta\u2019s flat panel antennas and terminals with Intelsat\u2019s global satellite network. Overall, the annual satellite conference continues to grow with 14,500 people registered in 2017, roughly eight percent more than 2016. Exhibits also were up, with 339 companies purchasing booths in 2017, a seven percent increase from last year, Lindsey Fuller, aerospace events group show director for Access Intelligence, a marketing and publishing company based in Rockville, Maryland, said by email.

    "content": "MOFFETT FIELD, California  \u2014 Within five years, companies could begin in-orbit manufacturing and assembly of communications satellite reflectors or other large structures, according to Made in Space, the Silicon Valley startup that sent the first 3D printer to the International Space Station in 2014. As Made in Space prepares to send a second 3D printer into orbit, the company is beginning work with Northrop Grumman and Oceaneering Space Systems on Archinaut, an ambitious effort to build a 3D printer equipped with a robotic arm that the team plans to install in an external space station pod, under a two-year, $20 million NASA contract. The project will culminate in 2018 with an on-orbit demonstration of Archinaut\u2019s ability to additively manufacture and assemble a large, complex structure, said Andrew Rush, Made in Space president. NASA\u2019s selected the Archinaut project, officially known as Versatile In-Space Robotic Precision Manufacturing and Assembly System, as part of its Tipping Points campaign, which funds demonstrations of space-related technologies on the verge of offering significant payoffs for government and commercial applications. Archinaut was one of three projects NASA selected in November that focus on robotic manufacturing and assembly of spacecraft and structures in orbit. \u201cWe are attempting to change the way we build space systems,\u201d Steve Jurcyk, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said Feb. 19 during a press briefing at Made in Space\u2019s office in the NASA Ames Research Park, Moffett Field, California. \u201cNow, we build things on the ground and launch them using fairly expensive and complicated rockets. We are seeking to create an infrastructure to build systems in space rather than launching them.\u201d That type of infrastructure would enable NASA and private space companies to launch the raw materials used in additive manufacturing along with certain high-value components like sensors, electronics and batteries. Once in orbit, robotic arms would mate the parts sent from Earth with additively manufactured elements, said Howard Eller, chief architect for advanced concepts at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. If on-orbit manufacturing and assembly are possible, they could revolutionize spacecraft design because engineers would no longer need to create structures capable of withstanding the force of Earth\u2019s gravity before they launch, fitting inside a rocket fairing or withstanding the vibration and acoustic forces of launch, Jurcyk said. Archinaut is a first step on that path. Made in Space is building Archinaut\u2019s 3D printer, which it plans to mate with a manipulator arm built by Oceaneering Space Systems. Northrop Grumman is providing systems engineering, control electronics, software, testing and assistance with Archinaut\u2019s space station interface. If tests in 2018 prove Archinaut performs as intended, Made in Space and its partners hope to continue the project by enlarging the additive manufacturing element and equipping it with additional robotic arms. Eventually, the companies envision a version of Archinaut with three robotic arms capable of latching onto orbiting structures to add or remove components, which eventually would enable companies to remove parts from decommissioned spacecraft and use the parts in new spacecraft, Eller said. That scenario offers the added benefit of cleaning up debris. \u201cThe problem with debris is that no one has an economic incentive to get rid of the stuff,\u201d Eller said. \u201cIf you can reuse the parts, there is an economic incentive because it costs $100 million to get all the stuff up there in the first place.\u201d",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/intelsat-hires-guggenheim-to-plot-debt-restructuring/",
    "content": "PARIS\u2014Satellite fleet operator Intelsat on Feb. 22 said it had hired Guggenheim Securities to assess unspecified \u201cfinancing and balance-sheet initiatives\u201d that company officials stressed was not a prelude a merger or acquisition \u2014 nor to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Intelsat said Guggenheim would be assisting in possible transactions \u201cincluding, among other things, evaluating the level of secured debt and balance sheet management opportunities.\u201d Intelsat had a total of $14.6 billion in debt as of Dec. 31, little changed from a year ago. The company has a revolving credit line it has not yet tapped, to which access is not constrained by any special covenants that throw it into doubt. \u201cWe have plenty of liquidity available to us,\u201d Intelsat Chief Financial Officer Jacques Kerrest said in a conference call with investors. \u201cWe are not using the revolver. We are absolutely fine for now.\u201d He conceded that Intelsat\u2019s cash requirements for debt repayment will increase starting in mid-2016 \u2013 a time when the company is in the middle of a big capital spending program for new satellites and is already investing in expertise as it positions itself to win new customers. Luxembourg- and McLean, Virginia-based Intelsat said it paid $890.3 million in interest in 2015, down nearly 6 percent from 2014 after several refinancing transactions that are likely to become more difficult in a higher-interest-rate environment. Intelsat reported revenue of $2.35 billion in 2015, down 4.9 percent from 2014, and told investors to expect another drop of around 8 percent in 2016. Backlog at Dec. 31 stood at $9.4 billion, flat from a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was 79 percent of revenue, also stable from a year ago. The company\u2019s fleet of about 50 satellites was 76 percent full as of Dec. 31, flat from last year. Intelsat Chief Executive Stephen Spengler said during the conference call that the company \u2013 and the entire satellite telecommunications industry \u2013 was facing pricing pressure on two fronts. The first is the arrival of new satellites in certain regions where supply is already outstripping demand. The second is the arrival of new high-throughput satellites, like Intelsat\u2019s Epic line, that offer far lower per-megahertz prices than traditional satellites. Intelsat\u2019s first Epic, launched in January, is scheduled to enter operations in April. Six other Epic satellites are to follow. Spengler said the sharp drop in the value of the Brazilian real will affect Intelsat because the company\u2019s Brazilian billing is done in local currency, unlike all other media and network systems customers, who are billed in U.S. dollars. In Russia, where the contract pricing is in dollars, Intelsat has been forced to renegotiate contracts with its most-valued customers to keep them out of the bad-debt column. Spengler said that despite Intelsat\u2019s possible loss of a five-year contract to provide the U.S. Navy with satellite connectivity worldwide \u2013 Intelsat has protested the way the bid has been formulated \u2013 demand from the U.S. government appears to have hit bottom and may be on the upswing. Intelsat said its Intelsat General Corp. subsidiary, which is devoted to government business, improved its contract renewal rate performance by 15 percent in 2015 versus 2014. Government revenue was $100.2 million in the three months ending Dec. 31, up 1 percent from the same period a year ago, but was down 6 percent, to $385 million, for the whole of 2015. Intelsat said it would be taking a non-cash impairment charge of up to $6.8 billion \u2014 the amount has not yet been determined \u2014 to reflect a decline in intangible assets since 2008, when a private-equity investment group led by BC Partners acquired a majority stake in Intelsat. During the call it became clear that some investors are nervous that the entire business model of fixed service satellite fleet operators \u2013 long-term revenue visibility, high gross-profit margins and a blue-chip customer base \u2013 might be coming undone, leading to much lower per-megahertz pricing. Spengler said that in some markets, notably the North American broadcast business, pricing remains stable, and that Epic should enable Intelsat to counter the broader downward pricing pressure by offering added-value services. So far, Spengler said, Intelsat has not seen the cannibalization of business \u2013 customers moving of conventional satellites to purchase lower-cost Epic capacity \u2013 that had been a concern as high-throughput capacity enters the market.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — Arianespace paused launch activity from Europe’s South American spaceport March 16 following the  French government’s announcement  that non-essential activities should be limited in response to the growing coronavirus pandemic.  Evry, France-based Arianespace’s next launch was scheduled for March 24 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. A Vega rocket was to launch 53 satellites in an all-smallsat rideshare mission to low Earth orbit.   Launch activity will resume “as soon as allowed by health conditions,” Arianespace said. Satellites and rockets in French Guiana are being placed in a “safe standby condition,” according to the company. Arianespace launches the heavy-lift Ariane 5 and light-lift Vega rockets exclusively from the Guiana Space Center. The company also launches medium-lift Russian Soyuz rockets from French Guiana, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, and the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia.  The French government moved over the weekend to order the closure of restaurants, cafés, movie theaters and other nonessential businesses. France is also discouraging travel and public gatherings and encouraging widespread telework.  Arianespace had begun prior to the French government’s  March 15 guidance  to implement travel restrictions and other measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.   Arianespace CEO Stéphane Israël said March 10 at the Satellite 2020 conference here that the company had decided to restrict launch attendance to required personnel, but wasn’t expecting any limitation in launching.The next day, the organizers of Satellite 2020 announced that the conference would be ending a day early on the advice of local authorities.",

    "content": "COLORADO SPRINGS — The head of the French space agency expects launch activity will resume soon at the European spaceport in French Guiana, where political protests have grounded Arianespace launches for the past two weeks. “The French government is working very hard to find a solution, and I am very, very confident that we will resume with the launches in the coming days,” CNES President Jean-Yves Le Gall said during an April 4 presentation at the 33rd Space Symposium here. The comments came the same day as  a group of protestors staged a sit-in in a conference room at the spaceport . Le Gall compared the protests disrupting daily life in the French overseas department that hosts Europe’s Guiana Space Centre to the California wildfires that delayed the launch of DigitalGlobe’s WorldView-4 satellite by a couple of months last year.  Le Gall did not give a timeframe for when he expects Arianespace to resume launching, saying only that the “launch pad is not available for launches.” CNES operates the space center, which Arianespace uses for Ariane 5, Soyuz and Vega launches.  At least five satellites awaiting Arianespace launches are looking at delays as the space center remains idled by protests that began two weeks ago over the French territory’s living and working conditions.  Those satellites are: In January, Arianespace set the goal of  12 launches this year , with the majority of those launches expected to happen by the end of April. So far the company has performed just three missions: the Soyuz launch of Hispasat-36W-1 in January, the Ariane 5 launch of Sky Brasil-1 and Telkom 3S in February, and the March Vega launch of Sentinel-2B. Reuters reported April 3 that French Guiana protest leaders are demanding $2.7 billion in aid from France, an amount French officials  have dismissed as unrealistic . ",

    "content": "PARIS — Startup satellite Internet service provider OneWeb LLC has leased 6,000 square feet (557 square meters) of office space outside Washington, in what company founder Greg Wyler said was one of several facilities to be established as OneWeb prepares to enter service over the next two years. OneWeb, based in Britain’s Channel Islands, intends to launch 720 small satellites into low Earth orbit for a global Ku-band broadband connectivity business. Most of the satellites will be launched aboard Russian Soyuz rockets from Russia’s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, starting in 2018. A Europeanized Soyuz, operated from France’s Guiana Space Center in South America, is scheduled to launch 10 test satellites in late 2017. The Evry, France-based Arianespace launch consortium, which will manage both the Baikonur and French Guiana launch campaigns, said Jan. 5 that plans remain on track for the first of 21 Soyuz OneWeb launches in late 2017. The test satellites are to be built by Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, France. The balance of the constellation will be manufactured at a still-unselected plant in the United States by a joint venture of OneWeb and Airbus. In a Jan. 5 interview, Wyler said the Washington venue, in addition to its proximity to the U.S. regulatory apparatus, is convenient because it’s near OneWeb partners  Hughes Network Systems, who will build OneWeb ground hardware ; and satellite fleet operator Intelsat, which is working to enable OneWeb customers to pass between OneWeb and Intelsat satellites – in geostationary orbit – when coverage demands it. OneWeb already has a small staff working at Hughes and Intelsat locations, and they ultimately will move to the new offices, located in Rosslyn, Virginia. Wyler said the aerospace talent pool around Washington is deep and includes broadband terminal provider iDirect and satellite builder Orbital ATK. The location is also near the former headquarters of geospatial-intelligence provider GeoEye Inc., since purchased by competitor DigitalGlobe. OneWeb Chief Executive Matt O’Connell is a former chief executive of GeoEye. Monday Properties, the real estate investment firm that owns the Rosslyn office, said the property includes a locker and shower facility.",

    "content": "The OneWeb-Airbus joint venture tasked with building 900 satellites for OneWeb plans to keep its first production line in France running to build satellites for other operators.  OneWeb Satellites is building the first 10 small satellites for OneWeb’s low-Earth orbit broadband constellation in Toulouse, France, before shifting production of the majority of the constellation to a new $85 million factory in Exploration Park, Florida.  But rather than let the infrastructure in France lay idle, OneWeb Satellites wants to repurpose the factory to build more small satellites.  “We always intended to maintain the line in Toulouse as long as we can,” Brian Holz, CEO of OneWeb Satellites, told  SpaceNews.  “Besides OneWeb, we are hoping to utilize the product in other markets. We will have the Florida lines up and running in the spring next year, and we will use Toulouse for some initial customers outside of OneWeb to begin selling those products.” Holz said other customers are interested in using OneWeb Satellite’s production volume in Toulouse for constellation projects of their own. He described the market as “very robust.” “I think it’s going to be really exciting when we get into next year,” he said. “You’ll see some other customers coming online soon.” OneWeb and Airbus created the joint venture with the ability to build satellites for other companies and organizations besides OneWeb, but so far no other customers have been announced. Holz said prospective customers have an interest in multiple mission types beyond telecommunications.  OneWeb Satellites will build other satellites roughly the same size as the 150-kilogram satellites under construction for OneWeb. Some designs may grow slightly larger, but OneWeb Satellites doesn’t intend to build much smaller than that.  “We won’t do everything. We are a certain size spacecraft with a certain capability and we can tweak some of the parameters a little bit. It’s not everything for everybody, but there are some very interesting things we can do,” he said.  OneWeb’s first launch is scheduled for March 2018 on a Soyuz rocket from Arianespace. Greg Wyler, OneWeb’s founder, said in June that the first production satellites from Toulouse should be leaving the factory for Arianespace’s  Kourou, French Guiana, launch site in October. Additional Soyuz launches are to ramp up after March in order for OneWeb to start operational service in 2019. Each Soyuz launch is to carry 32 satellites. “We will also use Toulouse as a production risk mitigation to Florida,” Holz added. “If we have interruptions in production for whatever reason, or we need to ramp the rate, Toulouse will allow us to do that.”",

    "title": "No damage to JWST after vibration test anomaly",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/no-damage-to-jwst-after-vibration-test-anomaly/",
    "content": "SANTA FE, N.M. — NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope shows no signs of damage after an “anomaly” during a vibration test earlier in the month, the agency announced Dec. 23. In a statement posted on the JWST website, NASA said that engineers were making progress tracking down the root cause of the Dec. 3 incident that halted vibration testing of the telescope’s mirror assembly and instruments, known as the Optical Telescope element and Integrated Science (OTIS). “All visual and ultrasonic examinations of the [telescope] structure continue to show it to be sound,” NASA said in the update. “Currently, the team is continuing their analyses with the goal of having a review of their findings, conclusions and plans for resuming vibration testing in January.” The OTIS assembly, which includes the telescope’s 6.5-meter segmented primary mirror, secondary mirror and associated structures, and its suite of four science instruments, were undergoing vibration testing at the Goddard Space Flight Center Dec. 3 when engineers detected “anomalous readings” from accelerometers attached to the telescope. NASA halted the vibration tests to study the data as well as inspect the telescope for any damage. NASA has not provided additional details on the nature of the vibration anomaly. The agency said in its latest update that, since the anomaly, the spacecraft team “successfully conducted two low level vibrations of the telescope.” The vibration tests, as well as planned acoustic tests, are designed to simulate the environment JWST will experience during its launch on an Ariane 5 in late 2018. “We are about to subject this beautiful beast, which is finished, to see if it will survive launch,” said John Mather, the JWST senior project scientist, at a Nov. 2 media event at Goddard about the telescope. “We expect it to, but we still have to prove it.” It’s unclear that effect the delay in the vibration and acoustic testing will have on JWST’s schedule. At the November event, Bill Ochs, NASA JWST project manager, said plans then called for shipping OTIS in February to the Johnson Space Center, where it will undergo thermal vacuum tests in a refurbished Apollo-era chamber there. It would then go in mid-2017 to a Northrop Grumman facility in Southern California to be integrated with the spacecraft bus and sunshield, and then undergo further testing before shipping to the French Guiana launch site in mid-2018. However, project officials have emphasized that JWST has healthy schedule reserves put into place after a “replan” of the project in 2011, when cost and schedule overruns threatened JWST with cancellation. Those reserves are intended to mitigate any effect on the mission’s overall schedule from testing delays. The replan provided JWST more schedule margin than required for a typical NASA project “because it’s Webb and we knew there would be additional complications,” said Scott Willoughby, Northrop Grumman vice president and program manager for JWST, in an interview at the Nov. 2 NASA event. “We’re right in line to where we need to be at this point in time, with two years to go before launch.”",

    "title": "Russia halts Soyuz launches from French Guiana",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/russia-halts-soyuz-launches-from-french-guiana/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Roscosmos announced Feb. 26 that it is halting cooperation with Europe on Soyuz launches from French Guiana and withdrawing its personnel from the launch site in response to European sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “In response to EU sanctions against our enterprises, Roscosmos is suspending cooperation with European partners in organizing space launches” from French Guiana, Roscosmos said in a pair of tweets, citing a statement by its head, Dmitry Rogozin. The agency said it will withdraw the 87 employees of several Russian companies that support Soyuz launches there, although the details of that withdrawal are “being worked out.” The announcement will, at a minimum, delay a Soyuz launch of two Galileo navigation satellites that had been scheduled for April from French Guiana, with another pair of Galileo satellites scheduled to launch later in the year on another Soyuz. The European Space Agency planned to launch its EarthCARE Earth science mission, developed in cooperation with the Japanese space agency JAXA, on a Soyuz in 2023, along with the Euclid infrared space telescope. The French government was also expected to launch its CSO-3 reconnaissance satellite on a Soyuz in early 2023. An ESA spokesperson told SpaceNews Feb. 26 that the agency had no immediate comment on the Roscosmos announcement. An “internal crisis coordination meeting” is scheduled for Feb. 28, after which ESA may issue a statement. Arianespace, which offers the Soyuz for commercial launches from French Guiana and other spaceports, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thierry Breton, the European Union commissioner whose portfolio includes space, said in a Feb. 26 statement that the decision has no immediate effects on the “continuity and quality” of the Galileo system or on the Copernicus series of Earth science spacecraft. “We will take all relevant decisions in response to this decision in due course and continue developing resolutely the second generation of these two E.U. sovereign space infrastructures,” he said. The decision to suspend Soyuz launches from French Guiana is one of the few levers on space-related issues that Russia can pull to react to Western sanctions without jeopardizing its own space capabilities, such as operations of the International Space Station. Western dependence on Russian space systems and technologies has declined significantly since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, when Russia threatened to cut off access to seats on Soyuz spacecraft flying to the ISS and halt exports of the RD-180 engines used on the Atlas 5 in response to U.S. sanctions. Future use of the French Guiana launch site by Soyuz rockets was in question even before the Roscosmos announcement. In January, Stéphane Israël, chief executive of Arianespace,  said he expected European institutional customers that had been using Soyuz to move to the Vega C and Ariane 6 vehicles , slated to make their first launches later this year. “We’ve had discussions with our Russian partners to see whether there is a business case to go beyond 2023 or not,” he said then, suggesting at the time that ESA support for continued Soyuz launches be discussed at the November ESA ministerial meeting. “It could be that maintaining a capability as a backup for Ariane 6 and Vega C could be part of the business case.” Roscosmos also announced via  a tweet  that Rogozin concluded that it was “inappropriate” for the U.S. to continue cooperation with Russia on the proposed Venera-D mission to Venus. That move is largely a ceremonial one because, while there have been discussions between American and Russian scientists on a potential role for NASA on Venera-D, the mission itself has suffered extensive delays and is unlikely to launch before the end of the decade, if at all.",

Satellite connectivity would support education for Afghan youth and women, he said. [Hindustan Times] GMV reported 140 million euros in 2019 space revenue ($152.5 million), up 30% year over year.  Space counted for more than half of the Spanish company’s 245 million euros in total revenue. Contracts to provide ground control infrastructure for the European Union’s Galileo satellites and OneWeb’s constellation of small broadband satellites contributed to that growth, GMV said. The company also received a contract last year to develop the processor for the French space agency CNES’s MicroCarb mission, and is participating in European Space Agency missions such as Space Rider, Heracles and ExoMars. [GMV] The European Space Agency has patented a family of signal compression standards  developed using its Proba-2 microsatellite. The standards help compress satellite telemetry data, reducing bandwidth needs when linking with ground stations. Satellite operators can use the freed up bandwidth to beam down more valuable data, such as scientific measurements or imagery, depending on the type of satellite.

    "title": "Bridenstine Sees New Potential for CHIRP",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/bridenstine-sees-new-potential-for-chirp/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A U.S. lawmaker who has been active in promoting wider government use of private sector space capabilities has raised the possibility of reactivating an idled missile-warning demonstration sensor hosted aboard a commercial telecommunications satellite. The Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload, commonly known as CHIRP, was installed and launched in September 2011 aboard the SES-2 telecommunications satellite owned by fleet operator SES of Luxembourg. Industry officials have touted CHIRP as a successful trailblazer that could lead to an increase in government payloads on commercial satellites. While active, the sensor was used to observe several launches, and the Air Force in October 2013 extended the CHIRP operating contract with SES, signing a deal that featured six-month options running through July 2015. Two months later, however, the service cut the experiment short due to budget pressures. During a panel discussion on commercially hosted government payloads at the Satellite 2015 trade show here, Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) said the sensor could find new life in monitoring weather conditions or wildfires. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at now is can the CHIRP mission can be turned back on for missions that aren\u2019t necessarily missile defense related,\u201d said Bridenstine, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. In the past, Air Force officials have said the CHIRP sensor could support federal and international agencies dealing with events such as volcanoes, floods, snow and ice accumulation, electrical grid blackouts and forest fires. Throughout its mission, CHIRP collected more than 300 terabytes of data on 70 missile and rocket launches, and 150 other thermal events, SES has said. Bridenstine said hosted payloads make sense for the Pentagon because the government should not worry about standard satellite infrastructure such as a satellite bus.    Instead it should focus its limited dollars on instruments specific to government requirements that may not have a broader commercial market. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see from an Armed Services [Committee] perspective is more military capabilities being put on hosted payloads,\u201d he said. The Air Force has created a contracting vehicle to standardize the processes and interfaces for placing dedicated military capabilities aboard commercial satellites. In June, the service awarded contracts to 14 space companies, effectively qualifying them to provide certain services and hardware in support of hosted payload missions. But Air Force officials have said the Hosted Payload Solutions, or HoPS, contracting vehicle likely will be used exclusively for civilian scientific missions for its first three to five years. If there is a sign of progress, military officials have said Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, which buys space hardware, now requires its directorates to formally consider hosted payloads as a possibility as the service examines new satellite architectures. Meanwhile, Bridenstine, also expressed hope that Congress would fund a Defense Department \u201cpathfinder\u201d program that was set up to examine new ways to procure communications services from the private sector. \u201cThe pathfinders need to be funded,\u201d Bridenstine said. Under the first pathfinder contract, awarded in June, SES Government Solutions of McLean, Virginia, is leasing the full capacity of an aging satellite covering Africa to a Pentagon customer. A request for information for the second pathfinder, under which the Air Force will experiment with the prelaunch purchase of a full transponder, was issued later that same month. Currently, however, there is no funding for the second pathfinder in the Air Force\u2019s 2016 budget request. \u201cThat\u2019s problematic,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cAs a member of Congress I\u2019m going to make sure, to the best I can, that Pathfinder 2 is funded. We\u2019re going to get that money put back in the budget.\u201d",

The JSpOC, headquartered at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, is the nerve center of U.S. military space operations, responsible for space surveillance, collision avoidance and launch support. The JSpOC Mission System (JMS) is a three-phased hardware and software upgrade project intended to improve the precision and timeliness of information managed by the center. The modernization effort, initiated in 2009, is expected to cost more than $500 million through 2017. It will enable the JSpOC to integrate data from multiple sources to give U.S. military commanders a comprehensive picture of the orbital environment. Intelligent Software Solutions specifically will work on a set of improvements known as Increment 2. Those improvements include moving away from the legacy Space Defense Operations Center and leaning more heavily on the new system and allowing software to classify satellite deorbits, re-entries, launches and other events. Work is expected to be complete by Sept. 30, 2016, the release said.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/virgin-galactics-launcherone-on-schedule-for-2016-first-launch/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Virgin Galactic is on schedule to begin flights of its small-satellite launch vehicle by the end of 2016, hoping to tap into what the company\u2019s chief executive believes is a lucrative and growing market. In a speech at the Satellite 2015 conference here, George Whitesides said the success of some small-satellite ventures in recent years, and the emergence of a number of new ones planning in some cases hundreds of satellites, offered a promising market for his company. \u201cThere\u2019s several key trends converging now in the small space sector that have the potential to reshape our industry,\u201d he said. Those trends include an \u201cinsatiable demand\u201d for communications and other data services, the application of mass production techniques to small satellites, and an influx of funding into the industry. That potential, he argued, can\u2019t be fully realized if companies have to rely on secondary payload accommodations on other launches or deployment from the International Space Station, as many smallsats are currently launched. \u201cWith those secondary opportunities, you hardly get any choice of where and when you can fly,\u201d he said. Whitesides hopes that Virgin Galactic\u2019s LauncherOne, first announced in 2012, can solve that by providing dedicated launches of small satellites, weighing up to about 225 kilograms, for less than $10 million. \u201cAs time has gone by, I\u2019ve only gotten more and more excited about it,\u201d he said. The company recently started hot-fire tests of an engine called Newton 3 developed by Virgin Galactic for the first stage of LauncherOne, Whitesides said. That engine, capable of generating 265,000 to 335,000 newtons of thrust, uses liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants. \u201cWe\u2019re now to the point where we\u2019re very confident that we can build a very affordable rocket,\u201d Whitesides said. After his speech, he said the company was on schedule to begin flights by the end of 2016, with even initial test flights likely carrying some satellites. When Virgin Galactic unveiled LauncherOne in July 2012, the company announced several initial customers, including Skybox Imaging, GeoOptics, Spaceflight, Inc. and Planetary Resources. The company has signed up several additional customers since then, Whitesides said, but has not disclosed them publicly. Virgin Galactic has also moved LauncherOne operations from the company\u2019s main facility in Mojave, California, to a new one in Long Beach, California, that the company announced in February. In addition to existing staff that moved to Long Beach, a job fair held March 7 at the Long Beach site attracted between 5,000 and 6,000 job applicants, Whitesides said, seeking about 100 open positions. The decision to move LauncherOne work to Long Beach was based on a desire to access a larger potential workforce than possible in Mojave, a small town about 150 kilometers from Los Angeles. Unlike the development of SpaceShipTwo, which was done in conjunction with Scaled Composites in Mojave, Whitesides said Virgin Galactic was free with LauncherOne to find other locations in southern California with a larger pool of qualified workers to draw from. Work continues on Mojave on a second SpaceShipTwo suborbital vehicle, replacing the one lost in a fatal crash in October 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re probably as much as 90-percent structurally complete\u201d on that vehicle, he said, although he said there were \u201cseveral months\u201d of work remaining on the vehicle\u2019s other systems before flight tests could begin. That work is in progress even as the National Transportation Safety Board continues its investigation into the accident. \u201cWe\u2019re a party in the investigation, so we can get a sense of what their findings are and, to the extent any are safety-related, we can act on them before the report comes out,\u201d he said, adding that he could not discuss any specific steps while the investigation is ongoing.",

    "title": "News from the ITU Symposium on Small Satellite Regulation",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/news-from-the-itu-symposium-on-small-satellite-regulation/",
    "content": "Ignoring U.N. Space Registry The United Nations Outer Space Treaty\u2019s Article 6 includes a Registration Convention mandating that every nation putting something into space register it with the U.N. Office of Outer Space Affairs (OOSA). \u201cThe Registration Convention provisions are binding,\u201d said Niklas Hedman, chief of OOSA\u2019s committee on policy and legal affairs, in a March 2 address to the ITU conference on small-satellite regulation in Prague. The problem is that not many governments appear to care a fig about the Registration Convention. They do not register their satellites. Government and industry officials interviewed here said many of the largest spacefaring nations, including the United States, fail to register their satellites. It is not just military satellites that are not there. Even some of the best-known commercial telecommunications and Earth observation spacecraft are not in the registry. \n\u201cThis has always been the case; no one does it,\u201d one government official said. \u201cWe have gotten used to it.\u201d Hedman, in his address, said, \u201cWe see positive trends\u201d in recent years, with more nations listing their satellites. Financial Incentive To Cheat Memo from small-satellite owners to national and international regulators: If you want us all to play by the rules, please adjust them to account for our financial resources. The alternative is to watch cheating develop into an art form, or to strangle a promising young industry. Exhibit A: licensing fees. Most nations have them \u2014 the United Kingdom is an exception, but the British system has costs elsewhere that others do not. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission has three categories of satellites: amateur, experimental and professional or operational. Amateur is free, experimental is $60 and operational is $430,000. Now guess which two categories are the most popular among owners of small satellites. \u201cYou can see why so many projects misuse the system,\u201d said one operator of a commercial constellation of small satellites. \u201cWe have private-sector financial backing and we file as operational satellites. But I do commiserate with those projects that try to get in under other categories.\u201d The International Telecommunication Union, which is the global regulator of wireless radio frequencies and orbital slots, thinks \u201camateur\u201d should be reserved for those serving members of the Radio Amateur Satellite Corp., Amsat. The ITU questions whether any satellite is \u201cexperimental\u201d in the regulatory sense unless it can prove that it shuts down whenever it is not beaming \u2014 experimentally \u2014 over its national territory. Orbital Debris Object Lesson Orbital debris experts say they view small-satellite owners as motorcyclists weaving through traffic, flouting the rules of the road everyone else must follow. Here is one reason why. Cubesat owner X, who will not be named here, was only able to get a launch into an 800-kilometer orbit because as a piggyback payload, as are most small satellites, his was subject to the demands of the main payload. The organization is on a tight university-type budget and put no propulsion on the satellite. But as the satellite moved into critical design review, the national government began adopting rules about orbital debris and the use of \u201cbest practices\u201d in space, including a requirement that low-orbit satellites remove themselves from orbit within 25 years of retirement. \u201cWe were able to get grandfathered so that our satellite was exempted from the rules,\u201d said a program manager, whose satellite is working well and is the pride of the technical team that built it. \nHow long will it remain in orbit? \u201cPossibly around 700 years,\u201d he said. ITU Vocabulary Lesson The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is asking small-satellite owners, and the national governments that make regulatory filings on their behalf, to stop saying their satellites will use ISM frequencies. \u201cThe ISM band is not allocated to any space service,\u201d said Yvon Henri, head of the ITU\u2019s space services department, referring to terrestrial frequencies reserved for industrial, scientific and medical purposes. \u201cIf you say you do not know your frequency plan, well, how do you establish a link budget? You need to submit the frequencies that, to your best knowledge, will be used.\u201d The ITU also would like smallsat owners to stop saying satellites are \u201cexperimental\u201d as they use low Earth orbit to beam all over Earth well beyond their national territories. Henri told the ITU Symposium on Small Satellite Regulation March 2 in Prague that \u201cexperimental\u201d frequencies are for terrestrial sources beaming over limited territory authorized by a national government. It is not experimental, he said, if it is crossing national borders dozens of times per day, as satellites in low Earth orbit tend to do. ITU does allow satellites, including amateur radio spacecraft, to be labeled \u201camateur\u201d and thereby escape the filing fee of 7,600 Swiss francs ($7,700) in ITU cost recovery fees. But here, too, the agency is finding too many satellite system owners trying to fit clearly precommercial or fully commercial systems into the \u201camateur\u201d category. The result is adults trying to fit into children\u2019s clothing, and as the number of small-satellite networks increases, the agency will be more vigilant in separating the amateurs from the rest. Surviving Antares Blast Last October\u2019s on-pad failure of an Orbital ATK Antares rocket carrying cargo for the international space station produced a telegenic fireball from which nothing, it seemed, could survive. \nBut something did. GomX-2, an apparently plucky cubesat \u2014 ironically equipped with is own deorbit experiment \u2014 came out of the fire and crash of the Cygnus payload module without a scratch, according to program managers at GomSpace Apps of Aalborg, Denmark. GomSpace Chief Technology Officer Jacob Molbach Nissen, speaking at the ITU Symposium on Small Satellite Regulation, said NASA found GomX-2 inside its Nanoracks deployer and returned it to the company. GomSpace said the week of March 9 that it had not yet conducted sufficient testing to determine whether the satellite\u2019s functionalities survived to the same degree as its outer appearance. \nOne industry official said GomX-2 was not the only satellite to have survived, but that for some reason the other owners are operating under a gag order of unclear origin. Dulles, Virginia-based Orbital ATK did not respond to a request for information on whether other satellites emerged OK. Nissen said GomSpace, formed in 2007, has exported small-satellite commercial, off-the-shelf components to 45 nations. Its first satellite, GomX-1, was launched in 2013 aboard a Russian-Ukrainian Dnepr rocket. The next, GomX-3, is scheduled for launch in June to the International Space Station, where it will be deployed next fall. Nissen said GomX is following the industry trend, which started some years ago with universities launching satellites of limited functionality into space, with the goal being more concerned with launching something than with the satellite\u2019s performance. The second phase permitted the use of cubesats for noncritical science missions. The current phase, he said, includes advances in cubesat components that allow their use by national security agencies for communications and border surveillance, and commercial applications.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Airbus Defence and Space on March 16 said it was moving its Skynet 5A military X- and UHF-band telecommunications satellite over the Asia-Pacific region to give the company near-global coverage for military users. The move, which has the blessing of the British Defence Ministry \u2013 the Skynet system\u2019s current anchor customer and possible future owner \u2013 should begin in the coming weeks. Skynet 5A is moving from its current slot at 6 degrees east longitude to 97 degrees east and should begin providing services at the new slot by midyear, the company said. Once it is in place, the Skynet fleet will be able to provide encrypted, jam-resistant capacity to allied governments from 178 degrees west to 165 degrees east. Airbus is already leasing the full X-band capacity on Telesat\u2019s Anik G1 commercial satellite. Airbus officials said here during the Satellite 2015 conference that the Anik G1 capacity is low-power and does not feature the encryption and jam resistance that are features of the Skynet 5 satellites, which were purpose-built for the British Defence Ministry with additional capacity sold to allied governments. NATO has leased capacity on Skynet, as have individual NATO governments. Airbus owns the Skynet satellites as part of a multibillion-dollar, two-decade contract with the British Defence Ministry. When the contract ends early in the next decade, the satellites \u2013 which Astrium financed \u2013 will revert to British military control in advance of a new competition to manage the system. Airbus is all but certain to compete for the new contract and may or may not have competition. In a statement released with the Airbus announcement of the Skynet 5A maneuver, Philip Dunne, British minister for defence equipment, support and technology, said moving the satellite over the Asia-Pacific \u201cis clear proof of how much our relationships with our international allies matter.This is the first time that we have had a secure communications capability in the region.\u201d Evert Dudok, head of Airbus\u2019 Communications, Intelligence and Security division, said demand for some Skynet services in Europe and the Middle East had dipped with the troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan. But the principal reason, and the reason Airbus proposed the move, is to meet demand in the Asia-Pacific region.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The European Satellite Operators Association, ESOA, on March 16 said it was expanding its reach into the Middle East, Africa and the former Soviet Union, bringing in a dozen new satellite operator members to add muscle on the eve of a regulatory battle with terrestrial wireless interests. The new members include the major operators in Africa and the Middle East and Central Asia, but with the notable exception of Russia\u2019s two main fleet operators, Russian Satellite Communications Co. and Gazprom Space Systems. Satellite operators worldwide have made clear their opposition to any surrender of C-band spectrum to terrestrial broadband providers at the World Radiococommunication Conference (WRC), scheduled this fall in Geneva. WRC meetings of world government regulators are held every three or four years by the International Telecommunication Union, the United Nations agency that regulates wireless radio spectrum and orbital slots. Terrestrial wireless broadband networks are looking for additional spectrum and have won at least some support for access to the lower portion of the C-band spectrum currently reserved for satellite links. \u201cThe geographic expansion of ESOA is also in response to the overwhelming push on satellite operators to combine their efforts and lead the charge to protect highly sought-after spectrum and retain their place as high value contributors to digital markets,\u201d ESOA said in a statement. Michel de Rosen, chief executive of Paris-based fleet operator Eutelsat and president of ESOA, said: \u201cPreserving access to our spectrum at WRC-15 is currently our number-one priority\u2026. We will have a louder voice by joining forces to ensure our users don\u2019t lose out and our massive investments are not in vain.\u201d The new ESOA members include Amos Spacecom of Israel, Arabsat of Saudi Arabia, Azercosmos of Azerbaijan, Es\u2019hailSat of the United Arab Emirates, Nigcomsat of Nigeria, Thuraya and Yahsat, both of the United Arab Emirates, Turksat of Turkey and Bulsatcom of Bulgaria.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Orbital Insight, a Silicon Valley startup that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite the processing of huge amounts of imagery, has secured $8.7 million in fresh financing from an investor group led by Sequoia Capital, the company announced March 16. The cash infusion will enable Mountain View, California-based Orbital Insight to hire more engineers and scale up its operations, which to date have been limited mostly to pilot projects funded by an initial $1.5 million in Sequoia-provided seed capital, said James \u201cJimi\u201d Crawford, who founded Orbital Insight in December 2013. Crawford, whose AI background includes Mars rover mission planning at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center and a stint at Google Books, the massive book digitization project, said the technology can automate the processing of reams of satellite imagery to generate useful information. The enabling trend, Crawford said, is the satellite imagery bonanza being created by newcomers like Skybox Imaging and Planet Labs, both of which are operating small imaging satellites today and have credible plans to populate large constellations offering frequent revisit times. The pilot projects, performed over the last year when Orbital Insight was a nine-person shop, have included using satellite imagery to count cars in store parking lots, enabling the company to predict sales of retailers well in advance of their earnings reports. Although the concept is not new, the application of AI \u2013 in which the software effectively \u201clearns\u201d how to count cars using techniques initially demonstrated by operators in the loop \u2013 allows the process to scale up to the point that it can cover millions of parking lots around the world. Similar processes and predictive analytics can be useful to the real estate, energy and agriculture industries, to name a few, Crawford said in an interview. Other participants in what Orbital Insight\u2019s Series A financing round include Bloomberg Beta, Google Ventures, citizen.vc and Lux Capital, Crawford said. The company is now expanding its engineering workforce from the current level of 18 to an expected 25 employees, Crawford said.

    "title": "U.S. Military Faces Weather Coverage Gap over Hot Zones",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/u-s-central-command-faces-weather-coverage-gap-over-hot-zones/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Air Force has warned lawmakers that it may have to depend on Chinese, Indian or Russian satellites as early as 2017 for weather coverage of the war-wracked region that includes the Middle East and Afghanistan. U.S. Central Command, which has responsibility for that broad region, has been relying on Europe\u2019s geostationary-orbiting Meteosat-7 satellite for constant weather coverage. But in 2014, Europe\u2019s civilian meteorological satellite organization, known as Eumetsat, said it would not replace Meteosat-7, which launched in 2006 and is expected to reach its end of life in 2017. The satellite provided cloud characterization, used in flying operations, and weather imagery, both of which were among the most pressing data gaps identified in a recent Air Force weather study. The result might be \u201cdiminished battlespace awareness\u201d over Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility, the Air Force said in a presentation to lawmakers late last year, according to briefing slides obtained by  SpaceNews . The issue surfaced during a Feb. 26 hearing of the House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee when Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) asked senior Defense Department witnesses whether they had reservations \u201cabout purchasing potentially sensitive information\u201d from Russia or China that would support U.S. troops. \u201cI have concerns that we have enough diversity in our capabilities so that we are not dependent on one particular country that may not be there to support [us] in the future,\u201d U.S. Navy Adm. Cecil Haney, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, responded. \u201cWe have to be very careful with that.\u201d Brian McKeon, principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, said he was \u201cnot familiar with a plan for anyone to rely on the Chinese or Russians.\u201d But according to the Air Force briefing slides, the Defense Department \u201ccurrently does not rely on non-allied international sources for environmental data, but may be required to do so as early as 2017.\u201d The service acknowledged that dependence on non-U.S. satellites \u201cdoes introduce added risk\u201d to Central Command\u2019s situational awareness capabilities. Although, Eumetsat, the Air Force and the civilian U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operate weather satellites in polar orbit, these do not provide constant surveillance of the area in question. Meteosat-7 provides persistent coverage from its geostationary-orbit position of 57 degrees east longitude over the Indian Ocean. The only other geostationary weather satellites expected to be in service over that area after 2017 are operated by China, India and Russia, the slides indicate. In the slides, the Air Force said it was encouraging NOAA to find additional international data sources, a task that has become \u201ca higher priority\u201d following Eumetsat\u2019s decision. Use of data from Chinese satellites likely would be problematic. In 2013, the House Armed Services Committee scolded the Defense Department for using satellite communications capacity that was indirectly leased from a company with substantial Chinese government ownership. In November, NOAA acknowledged it fell victim to \u201can Internet-sourced attack\u201d on four of its websites, disrupting the flow of satellite data to the National Weather Service. Then-Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), a vocal China hawk who was chairman of the House Appropriations commerce, justice, science subcommittee that funds NOAA and NASA, accused China of being behind the attack. Wolf has since retired, but his successor as subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas), has pledged to stay vigilant with respect to China. Russia would be equally troublesome. House Armed Services Committee members, including Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), the strategic forces subcommittee chairman, have opposed any perceived cooperation with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. The committee is expected to take up this issue in hearings this spring, congressional sources said.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/u-s-air-force-targets-2016-for-outsourcing-wgs-operations/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Air Force hopes to outsource the day-to-day operation of its Wideband Global Satcom communications satellites as early as next year, according to a top service official. The Air Force has been taking exploratory steps toward fully outsourcing most of its satellite operations for nearly a year. In theory, such a move could save money by allowing the service to reduce or possibly even eliminate much of its satellite control infrastructure, industry sources have said. It would also allow Air Force staff to concentrate on other duties. But at a breakfast here March 11, Dave Madden, executive director of the Air Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles, laid out the clearest timetable yet for such a transition. \u201cI\u2019m hoping 2016 is going to be the year we finally take the command and control for WGS and move it over to a commercial service,\u201d Madden said. Air Force Space Command has been looking for ways to reduce its operations costs as certain Defense Department budgets have shrunk in recent years. The situation has the potential to worsen with the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration still on the table for fiscal year 2016. Industry sources have said these pressures are pushing Space Command to explore cost-cutting measures sooner rather than later. At the same time, Gen. John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command, wants operators to spend more time on battle management and less time on the day-to-day flying of the satellites, Madden said. Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems of El Segundo, California, is the prime contractor on the WGS program. To date, six of a planned 10 WGS satellites are in orbit. Already, WGS launch support, checkout and other tasks are handled at a Boeing facility, Madden said. \u201cThe networks are there to do this,\u201d he said. If outsourcing is successful on the WGS satellites, a similar model could be applied to the Air Force\u2019s GPS satellites, Madden said. In September, the Air Force awarded satellite control commercialization study contracts of undisclosed amounts to Intelsat General Corp. of Bethesda, Maryland; Northrop Grumman Corp. of Falls Church, Virginia; Universal Space Network of Horsham, Pennsylvania; and Raytheon Intelligence and Information Systems of Dulles, Virginia. Those Commercial Provisioning study contracts, which wrapped up in December, were used to examine scenarios for commercializing the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), which operates and controls many of the Defense Department\u2019s satellites. \u201cWe gained valuable information from the Commercial Provisioning study, which will be assimilated into our broader analysis on how to integrate operations across multiple satellite programs,\u201d Master Sgt. Kevin Williams, a spokesman for Air Force Space Command, said in a March 5 email. For the amount of money the Air Force is paying to sustain the WGS constellation, Madden said, the service could pay to have a commercial operator both sustain and fly the satellites. Commercials satellite operators employ just a small fraction of the staff the Air Force traditionally uses to fly satellites. In addition, Madden said, the service often trains operators only to see them move to different jobs a few years later.",

    "content": "PRAGUE \u2014 The astonishing increase in the number of small satellites being launched singly or by the dozen has caused friction between international regulators on the one side and, on the other, satellite developers and some national governments that look the other way instead of enforcing the rules, industry and regulatory officials said. Officials at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations agency that regulates orbital slots and radio frequencies, said they are girding for even more regulatory challenges as ostensibly well-financed companies planning low-orbiting constellations to offer global Internet access seek frequency coordination at the agency. The nature of the small-satellite revolution \u2014 now featuring low-cost, quickly developed satellites whose owners would prefer to test in orbit and then throw away the hardware rather than test to perfection before a first launch \u2014 is enough to merit special regulatory consideration, some small-satellite owners say. Anticipating the stresses on the international regulatory regime caused by swarms of mainly low-orbit smallsats, the ITU in 2012 asked its specialists to consider a separate regulatory regime dedicated to these kinds of spacecraft. The idea behind the initiative, which was backed recently by the U.S. Satellite Industry Association, was that current ITU rules were ill-fitting for owners of low-budget small satellites, especially since they often ride to orbit as piggyback passengers, with the main satellite payload driving the orbital injection point. Three years later, those charged with examining such a new regulatory regime have thrown up their hands. Addressing the ITU Symposium and Workshop on Small Satellite Regulation here March 2-4, they said there is no workable definition of a small satellite that can be found. By some definitions, they said, the International Space Station would be classified as a small satellite. \u201cWe are really now not sure if any such special regulatory regime should be created,\u201d said Yvon Henri, head of the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau\u2019s Space Service Department. \u201cThere is no definition of what a small satellite is and if I understand the results we have heard, maybe there will never be one.\u201d The ITU classifies satellites not so much by what they are, but what they do and what orbit they use. A 5-kilogram cubesat that broadcasts in a frequency to which it has no rights, and which is interfering with another satellite, is just as guilty of interference as a 6,000-kilogram telecommunications satellite in geostationary orbit infringing on a neighboring satellite\u2019s frequencies. And governments whose national regulatory regimes are used to register small satellites have just as much responsibility to deliver honest information to the ITU about these spacecraft \u2014 their planned orbits, whether they are commercial or experimental or amateur radio, and the radio frequencies to be used \u2014 as they do for larger satellites. Fifty-eight years after Sputnik, what goes on in Earth orbit continues to exhibit Wild West characteristics, with nations telling occasionally egregious untruths to the ITU and getting away with it. Challenging the honesty of a sovereign nation is not in the ITU playbook. Attila Matas, head of the ITU\u2019s Space Publication and Regulation division, called these \u201cdirty tricks\u201d that nations use to pretend they are doing one thing in orbit but actually doing another. As it has been in geostationary orbit, where a global multibillion-dollar annual business has developed, so it may be with smallsats. Orbital debris hazards are never far from any discussion about swarms of small satellites. The general consensus is that, depending on its area-to-mass ratio and its specific shape, a satellite launched into an orbit of around 650 kilometers or lower with no propulsion system of its own will re-enter the atmosphere and be destroyed within 25 years. A satellite launched into a higher orbit will remain there for centuries. The leading spacefaring nations have adopted debris mitigation guidelines including one that says low-orbiting satellites should be equipped to re-enter within 25 years of the end of their mission, but international regulators have no charter to enforce this. It is routinely violated. National regulatory agencies \u2014 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the French space agency, CNES, are examples \u2014 sometimes insist on the 25-year rule as a condition to approving a launch or granting an operating license. But these remain exceptions, and even in the United States and France there are many waivers granted. Henri and Matas told the symposium, where small-satellite owners and developers outnumbered regulators, that they wanted the sector to continue to thrive and to deliver on its promise of lowering the cost of providing space-based services. \u201cThe new constellations will force geostationary satellite operators to lower their prices,\u201d Henri said, referring to the several mega-constellation proposals that have arrived at the ITU in the past few months. But coordination of these constellations\u2019 broadcast frequencies \u2014 in Ku- and Ka-band mainly \u2014 with pre-existing satellite systems \u201cwill be very complicated,\u201d he said. Responding to small-satellite owners\u2019 concerns, they said the ITU does not need to know, at the time of an initial regulatory filing, the precise orbit of a small satellite given that it is the main payload that determines the orbit and the main payload and launch vehicle may not be known at the time of the filing, called Advance Publication of Information, or API. \n The only metric that is inviolable when the first notice to the ITU is sent \u2014 the one that puts a satellite system in the queue and preserves its rights \u2014 is the frequency to be used. A proposed 1,000-satellite constellation at 1,200 kilometers in altitude that morphs into a 12-satellite network at 8,000 kilometers by the time the system is formally notified would not lose its API status so long as the broadcast frequencies have not changed, ITU officials said. An expedited regulatory filing regime, they said, makes API filings relatively straightforward \u2014 if not always free of charge, depending on the satellite\u2019s mission. \u201cWe do not want to police you \u2014 we are not the police,\u201d Matas said. \u201cThat is not our job. We want only to follow the rules to preserve the use of the resource.\u201d",

    "content": "PARIS \u2014 Satellite broadband hardware and services provider ViaSat Inc. on March 13 said it had concluded terms for a $524.9 million direct loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to cover the costs of the ViaSat-2 Ka-band satellite to be launched in mid-2016 from Florida. The loan, which will finance a Carlsbad, California-based ViaSat\u2019s purchase of a satellite from another California company and its launch by yet another Californian, is an example of the creative uses to which export-credit-agency funding can be put in search of favorable loan terms. The 6,740-kilogram ViaSat-2 satellite is being built by Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems of El Segundo, California and will be launched aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket built and operated by SpaceX of Hawthorne, California. The fig leaf needed to secure the deal (which is not the first of its kind) is a heretofore unknown ViaSat subsidiary in Dorset, England \u2013 ViaSat Technologies Ltd. \u2013 which is the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s counterparty. Under the terms of the loan, $476 million may be used to finance up to 85 percent of the costs associated with the construction and launch of ViaSat-2, with the remainder set aside for other expenses associated with the loan. Repayment, in 17 semi-annual installments, is to start within six months of ViaSat-2\u2019s entry into service. The Commercial Interest Reference Rate in effect during the five days before the first withdrawal will set the interest rate for the deal. That rate is now 2 percent and 2.5 percent annually.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/lockheed-martin-pitches-reusable-tug-for-space-station-resupply/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lockheed Martin confirmed March 12 that it submitted a proposal for NASA\u2019s commercial cargo competition, offering a system that includes a reusable tug that can be used for other applications, including supporting human missions beyond Earth orbit. \u201cWe\u2019re unveiling a solution that goes beyond the space station, a solution that will allow us to set the stage for a revolution in commercial exploration,\u201d said Jim Crocker, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Space Systems International, in an event here to announce their system. The company\u2019s system features two key components: a reusable tug called Jupiter and a cargo module called Exoliner. Initially, the two would be launched together on a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket  and berth with the International Space Station in much in the same way as existing commercial cargo vehicles. At the end of its mission at the ISS, the cargo vehicle would depart and fly independently for weeks or months. During this time it would be able to carry out additional missions, such as the deployment of small satellites or remote sensing of the Earth. Follow-on cargo missions would launch only Exoliner modules. Jupiter and the old Exoliner would rendezvous with the Centaur upper stage carrying the new Exoliner module, and Jupiter would use its robotic arm to swap the modules. Jupiter then returns to the ISS with the new cargo module, while the Centaur deorbits the old one. The Jupiter tug, based on interplanetary spacecraft like the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution orbiter Lockheed helped build and launch in 2013, is designed to operate in orbit for extended periods. \u201cIn essence it has an unlimited life,\u201d said Crocker, since the vehicle can be refueled and serviced on orbit. The company did not offer specific pricing details, but emphasized what it termed the \u201caffordability\u201d of the system by noting that many key systems, such as sensors and other electronics, are incorporated into Jupiter and thus need to be built only once. \u201cThe expensive part of this system stays in orbit and is reused on every mission,\u201d Crocker said. The system can carry up to 5,000 kilograms of pressurized cargo and 1,500 kilograms of unpressurized cargo per mission, the maximum set by NASA in its Commercial Resupply Services 2 (CRS-2) request for proposals last September. The amount of cargo it can dispose of is limited only by the volume of the cargo container, company officials said; NASA requires a minimum of 2,500 kilograms of cargo disposal per mission. Lockheed Martin said it is developing the cargo system with two international partners. Thales Alenia Space is providing the cargo module, based on the cargo carrier it built for Europe\u2019s Automated Transfer Vehicle. Canada\u2019s MDA Corp. is building the robotic arm for Jupiter. All of the major components of Jupiter and Exoliner have flight heritage. \u201cSelecting hardware that has been effectively demonstrated on the space station has got to be a solution that provides a level of comfort\u201d to NASA, said Wanda Sigur, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Space Systems civil space line of business. In addition to servicing the ISS and potential future commercial space stations, Lockheed Martin said this system could also support operations beyond Earth orbit. A Jupiter and Exoliner module could be launched, along with an Orion spacecraft, on a single Space Launch System booster, serving as a habitat and logistics module for extended stays in cislunar space. \u201cAlthough our priority is going to be servicing the ISS,\u201d said Josh Hopkins, a Lockheed Martin space exploration architect, \u201cwe\u2019re also designing the system from the beginning to be able to do deep space missions.\u201d Lockheed Martin is the latest company to confirm its bid in what has become a crowded field for the CRS-2 competition. Boeing, Orbital ATK, and Sierra Nevada Corp. said in December that they submitted CRS-2 proposals. SpaceX, which, along with Orbital ATK, has contracts today to deliver cargo to the ISS, is widely believed to have also proposed, but the company has declined to publicly confirm that. NASA plans to select at least two companies by June. Sierra Nevada, which lost to Boeing and SpaceX in NASA\u2019s commercial crew competition last year, announced March 12 that it would provide details of its CRS-2 bid, called the Dream Chaser Cargo System, at a briefing here March 17.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/senators-bolden-clash-over-the-core-mission-of-nasa/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Members of the Senate Commerce space subcommittee used a March 12 hearing on the NASA budget to debate with each other, and the head of the agency, about what the agency\u2019s priorities should be. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), chairman of the subcommittee, expressed concern that NASA was spending too much money on Earth science and not enough on exploration programs. \u201cSince the end of the last administration, we have seen a disproportionate increase in the amount of federal funds that have been allocated to the Earth science program, at the expense of, and in comparison to, exploration and space operations, planetary science, heliophysics, and astrophysics,\u201d he said in his opening remarks. To illustrate his point, Cruz displayed a chart showing that NASA\u2019s request for Earth science funding had increased 41 percent between the 2009 and the 2016 budget proposals, while other NASA programs saw either decreases or far smaller increases. \u201cIn my judgment, this does not represent a fair or appropriate allocation of resources,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is shifting resources away from the core functions of NASA.\u201d Bolden, asked by Cruz to define the \u201ccore mission\u201d of NASA, defended the agency\u2019s work by citing language in the National Aeronautics and Space Act that created the space agency. \u201cEssentially, our core mission from the very beginning has been to investigate and explore space and the Earth environment, and to help us make this place a better place,\u201d he said. Cruz disagreed. \u201cI would suggest that almost any American would agree that the core function of NASA is to explore space,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what sets NASA apart from any other agency.\u201d Another Republican on the subcommittee, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), also said NASA was investing too much in Earth science over exploration. \u201cIt seems to me that NASA has perhaps drifted away from its core mission, and I\u2019m concerned about that,\u201d he said. Democratic members, however, defended the agency\u2019s work in Earth science as part of its overall scope of missions. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who was named the ranking member of the space subcommittee March 3, argued that an increase in Earth science funding was a recovery from past cuts. \u201cWe must avoid false choices between robotic exploration, human exploration, the study of the universe, or the study of our own planet,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \u201cWe must avoid the temptation to view NASA\u2019s mission as a set of competing priorities.\u201d \u201cIn some quarters, it seems to be fashionable to say that Earth science is not part of the exploration program,\u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), ranking member of the full committee. Work on Earth science, he said, was linked to all of the agency\u2019s initiatives. Bolden made a similar argument, arguing that NASA\u2019s exploration program was dependent on a variety of other NASA programs, including Earth science. \u201cWe can\u2019t go anywhere if the Kennedy Space Center goes underwater and we don\u2019t know it,\u201d he said. Cruz indicated at the end of the hearing that he planned to revisit the issue in a future authorization bill. \u201cIt is my hope that this committee will work in a bipartisan manner to help refocus those priorities where they should be: to get back to the hard sciences, to get back to space, to focus on what makes NASA special,\u201d he said. Beyond the discussion about NASA\u2019s roles, Bolden used the hearing to quietly promote the nomination of Dava Newman as the agency\u2019s deputy administrator. Newman, present at the hearing, was nominated by the White House for the position in October 2014, but has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. \u201cOne of these days you all, hopefully, if this committee seeks to support her, will have someone who can come before this committee and speak very authoritatively,\u201d he said in response to a question on aeronautics research. Newman is a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Nelson indicated he supported the nomination, noting Bolden has been making progress at NASA despite not having a deputy for a year and a half. \u201cHe\u2019s got everybody pulling in the right direction, which is a significant accomplishment for the administrator,\u201d he said of Bolden.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — Saber Astronautics announced Nov. 23 it has signed an agreement with Axiom Space to facilitate Australian astronauts’ participation in future missions to the International Space Station. Axiom is a private space infrastructure company that plans to build a commercial space station. The company in February  will take three private astronauts  on its first mission to the ISS on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Saber Astronautics, a space venture with operations in Australia and the United States, will use the agreement with Axiom to build up interest in human spaceflight and space-based research. The goal is to give Australian astronauts and space companies “access to the station’s orbiting microgravity laboratory and develop a new generation of products for human health, materials, electronics, clean tech and more,” Saber said.   “Saber is already reaching out to commercial organizations and private individuals to gauge interest in their participation in future Axiom missions,” said a spokesperson.   Axiom’s first mission Ax-1 will bring to the ISS three private customers from the United States, Canada and Israel. They will perform 25 experiments over a one week stay on the station. Saber owns and operates the Responsive Space Operations Centre (RSOC) based in Adelaide and Colorado. The Adelaide RSOC last year received $6 million in funding from the Australian Space Agency’s space infrastructure fund. “Supporting astronauts is a long-term goal of Saber’s RSOC program accelerated by the agreement with Axiom,” the company said.   The program to be run by Saber will train the companies that participate as well as help them determine which products can benefit from research and experiments on the ISS, said Saber. “This allows a path for Australians to be astronauts and work independently without requiring a change of citizenship to the U.S. or European Union.”",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — After making history on the first crewed flight of an orbital spacecraft launched from the United States in nearly nine years, two NASA astronauts are settling in on the International Space Station. Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley arrived at the ISS May 31, 19 hours after the Crew Dragon spacecraft they were on launched from the Kennedy Space Center. They will remain on the station for up to four months, joining the station’s crew of NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Roscosmos cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. While Behnken and Hurley trained primarily to test SpaceX’s commercial crew spacecraft so that NASA can certify it for use on more routine missions, the shortfall in crew on the ISS mean the two will also be spending time helping out with station operations. That work has already started, Cassidy said in a June 1 media event. “Today is day one, and they’re hitting the ground running, unloading the vehicle. We’ve got HTV right at our feet and we’ll be working in there in very short order.” The H-2 Transfer Vehicle, or HTV, is a Japanese cargo spacecraft that launched to the ISS May 20 and was berthed to the station five days later. It carried several tons of cargo for the station. The HTV also brought to the station a final set of new lithium-ion batteries for the station’s power system, whose installation requires a set of spacewalks. Both Behnken and Cassidy have spacewalk experience, and NASA is considering having them perform those spacewalks, or EVAs, in the next several weeks. “That’s going to take somewhere on the order of four to five EVAs to install those. At this point, we are looking at all options that could allow us to do those EVAs while we have Bob and Doug on board,” Kenny Todd, NASA deputy ISS program manager, said at a May 31 press conference. How long Behnken and Hurley will remain on the station is an open question. NASA officials say several factors go into that assessment, including the health of the Crew Dragon spacecraft as well as the readiness of the next such spacecraft, which NASA currently plans to launch Aug. 30 on a mission called Crew-1 with four astronauts from NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA on board. Steve Stich, deputy program manager of the commercial crew program, said at the May 31 briefing that they’ll be watching the health of the solar arrays on the Crew Dragon in particular, looking for any degradation in their performance. Neither NASA nor SpaceX have explained why those solar panels appear to be more sensitive than those used on other spacecraft, or the station itself. Stich said they will power on the Crew Dragon spacecraft weekly to test its solar arrays. “It’ll probably take a few weeks to get trending on that,” he said. “In a month or so, we’ll be able to make a decision as to how long to keep this vehicle in orbit.” Behnken acknowledged that uncertainty during the June 1 media event. “Several recent crews have had a little bit more uncertainty than we’ve had historically for how long their mission duration was going to be,” he said, referring to NASA decisions to extend the stays of some individual astronauts, driven in part by commercial crew delays. “Doug and I have maybe the most uncertainty, because it could be relatively short or we could potentially double or triple, maybe, what was originally expected for us just a few short months ago.” One ceremonial thing the Demo-2 astronauts have done is “capture the flag.” The final shuttle mission, STS-135, left behind on the station a small American flag that also flew on the first shuttle mission, STS-1 in 1981. The flag was to remain on the station until the next American crewed spacecraft arrived. “Chris had it right on the hatch where we left it nine years ago,” said Hurley, who was part of the STS-135 crew. He then displayed the flag, to which he said Cassidy added a note: “Do not forget to take with Crew Dragon.” “You can bet we will take it with us when we depart back to Earth,” Hurley said. “We are lucky enough to be able to take it home with us, and that will be our plan here in a month or two or three or four.”"

    "content": "WASHINGTON — The private astronauts who spent two weeks on the International Space Station in April said they tried to pack too much into their schedules while on the station, putting a strain on both themselves and the professional astronauts there. At a May 13 news conference, the four people who flew on Axiom Space’s Ax-1 mission to the station said that while they had a good trip to the station, they overestimated how much work they could get done after  their arrival at the ISS April 9  for what was originally scheduled to be an eight-day stay. “Our timeline was very aggressive, especially early in the mission,” said Michael López-Alegría, the former NASA astronaut and current Axiom employee who commanded Ax-1. “The pace was frenetic in the beginning.” “With the value of hindsight, we were way too aggressive on our schedule, in particular the first couple days,” said Larry Connor, one of the three customers who accompanied López-Alegría on Ax-1. He gave an example of one experiment that was scheduled to take two and a half hours to complete based on preflight training but ended up taking five hours. López-Alegría thanked the four Crew-3 astronauts from NASA and the European Space Agency who were on the station during their visit for assistance, calling them “extraordinarily helpful, gracious, kind, sharing” during their stay. “I can’t say enough good things about them, and we really needed them.” That had an impact on the Crew-3 astronauts’ own work schedule. During a May 12 meeting of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, Susan Helms, a former NASA astronaut who serves on the panel, said the Ax-1 visit posed “no apparent overt safety issues” but that it did affect the performance of the astronauts. “There were some real-time dynamics related to the flight crew timelines with the addition of these four Axiom personnel, who did have their own flight objectives,” she said. “In essence, the arrival of the Axiom personnel seemed to have a larger-than-expected impact on the daily workload on the professional International Space Station crew.” While the Ax-1 mission did allow for some new science, and the ability to transport some NASA cargo back to Earth, “there was also some opportunity cost in the form of overly stressing the workload of the onboard ISS members and the mission controllers who support them on the ground,” Helms said. She recommended that future private astronaut missions be managed in “normalized processes” that fully integrate them into overall ISS activities. “It’s incumbent on us to reduce our burden on the crew,” said Michael Suffredini, president and chief executive of Axiom Space, at the news conference, saying that was part of “lessons learned” discussions with NASA and SpaceX that will inform future missions to the station. “Over time, we’ll reduce what the crew has to do.” One way to reduce that burden is to stretch out the work over a longer stay. The Ax-1 mission ended up spending more than 15 days at the ISS, rather the original 8 days, because of unfavorable weather conditions at landing sites off the Florida coast.  “It was a blessing to have the extra time,” López-Alegría said. “I think we were so focused on research and outreach in the first 8 or 10 days on orbit that we needed the extra time to complete the experience by having time to look out the window, to make contact with friends and family, to just enjoy the sensation.” Suffredini said longer missions would have to fit into a busy schedule on the ISS and address issues such as effects on the life support system of having 11 people there for an extended period. He did note, though, that Axiom has planned 30-day missions to the station and would like to go as long as 60 days. “This flight was really wildly successful,” he said. “From our perspective, we will go be a little more efficient, train a little differently, do a few things to help out the timeline.”  He added the company had sold three seats on future missions since Ax-1, which included  an agreement announced April 29 with the United Arab Emirates to fly an Emirati astronaut on a long-duration mission  using a seat provided by NASA in exchange for a Soyuz seat Axiom had previously purchased from Roscosmos. He declined to disclose the other customers who signed up."

    "title": "Astronauts Repair Space Station Satellite Deployer",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/astronauts-repair-space-station-satellite-deployer/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — Astronauts on the International Space Station have made repairs to a set of small satellite deployers that malfunctioned several months ago, a move that the company that provided them calls a milestone for commercial activities there. The deployer system, used to eject cubesat-sized spacecraft from the ISS, broke down in August, failing to release satellites when commanded. During the troubleshooting process in September, two satellites were inadvertently released. The deployers were returned inside the ISS through the airlock in the Japanese Kibo module in mid-September. While NanoRacks, the Houston-based company that provided the deployers, has built new deployers to correct the problem, it worked with NASA and other ISS partners to also attempt to repair the deployers currently on the station. “After several months of hard work, we made adjustments to the deployers,” said Jeffrey Manber, managing director of NanoRacks, in an interview Feb. 17. The problems with the deployers were traced to screws that were not tightened correctly, he said, as well as issues with a power feed. “It was a couple of different things, and we think we’ve corrected it,” he said. The repair work, Manber said, included installation of a new electronics system for the deployer and latches to prevent the premature deployment of the satellites. A SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft delivered the repair hardware to the ISS in January. The station’s crew made the repairs and successfully tested the latches on Feb. 17, and planned to attempt satellite deployments the week of Feb. 23. Those repair plans took several months of coordination with NASA, Roscosmos, the Japanese space agency JAXA, and the Aerospace Corp., who NanoRacks had brought in to support the investigation of the deployer problem. “We had to go through a review process” with those space agencies, he said. “There was some questioning about whether we should attempt this on-orbit repair, but NASA has been very supportive.” Manber said the company went through the time and effort of the repair process, instead of waiting to ship new deployers to the station, to demonstrate that the ISS is a “robust” platform for commercialization. “We could have brought the payloads down and thrown them away,” he said. “This is to try and fix something that didn’t work, with the same satellites on it.” He cautioned that there’s no guarantee that the repairs will fix the problems with the deployers, but that the addition of the latches, specifically requested by JAXA, should eliminate any risk to the station from an accidental deployment of satellites. “These are the deployers that did not work last time, so they may not work this time,” he said. “We think we’ve fixed it, but we know we’ve made it safe.” In addition to the repaired deployers on the station and new ones of a similar design slated to go to the station later this year, NanoRacks has been developing a new small satellite deployment system called Kaber. That system will be able to support launching both cubesat-class spacecraft as well as larger microsatellites weighing up to 50 kilograms. The hardware for Kaber is being built now, NanoRacks external payloads manager Kirk Woellert said at an ISS utilization workshop the company held here Feb. 17. Kaber will be delivered to the ISS this summer on the seventh SpaceX Dragon cargo mission, with the first microsatellite deployments using it expected by the end of the year. Even if the repaired deployers don’t work, Manber said that the effort that went into attempting the repair was worthwhile. “It involved astronauts, multiple agencies, NanoRacks, everybody working together,” he said. “It’s a major step forward, using the space station for commercial on-orbit repair.”",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-still-working-with-russia-on-iss-seat-barter-agreement/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — NASA officials say they are still hopeful to complete a seat barter agreement with Russia in time to allow an exchange of seats on missions this fall despite the tensions between Russia and the West. At briefings March 31 about the upcoming Crew-4 Crew Dragon mission to the International Space Station, scheduled for launch April 20, agency officials said they were still waiting for Roscosmos and Russia’s foreign ministry to approve an agreement that would allow Russian cosmonauts to fly on commercial crew vehicles in exchange for NASA astronauts flying on Soyuz spacecraft to the station. NASA has along emphasized the importance of such arrangements that ensure there would be at least one Russian and one American on the station in the event either Soyuz or commercial crew vehicles were not available for an extended period. The agreement allowing the exchange was, as of earlier this year, pending approval by the Russian government. The goal at the time was to have the agreement in place to allow  a Russian cosmonaut, Anna Kikina , to go on the Crew-5 mission launching in September, while a NASA astronaut, rumored to be Frank Rubio, would go on the Soyuz MS-22 mission also launching in September. That goal remains in place, but agency leaders said time is running out. “At some point, if we don’t get the paperwork out of the Russian and over to our side,” said Kathy Lueders, NASA associate administrator for space operations, “we won’t have enough time to be able to support crew training and operations for Crew-5. But we still feel like that’s our long-term logistics strategy.” Neither Lueders nor Dana Weigel, NASA ISS deputy program manager, gave a specific deadline for completing the agreement to preserve a seat exchange in the fall. Weigel said one critical timeline is building the suits, which are different for Soyuz and Crew Dragon. “I don’t have specific schedules,” she said. “Everyone continues to refine how far out you can push that.” Training is another factor, with some cosmonauts having recently been in the United States for training but none currently. “There’s a point in time where you hit a limit,” she said of those preparations. “We’re not there yet. We’re still both working jointly on that and we’re hopeful we can stay on those timelines.”  If the agreement isn’t ready in time, there is a plan for a backup crew member to go on Crew-5 in place of Kikina, said Steve Stich, NASA commercial crew program manager. “I think we have a little more time before we have to pull the trigger on a backup crew member.”  Those discussions continue while questions remain about Russia’s long-term commitment to the ISS, particularly after sanctions imposed by Western nations after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Dmitry Rogozin, head of Roscosmos, suggested in March he would make some kind of decision about Russia’s future on the station if sanctions were not lifted by the end of the month. Those sanctions remain in place. NASA officials reiterated that ISS operations remain normal with no changes to operations, including efforts to secure an extension of the station from 2024 to 2030. Lueders said the ISS partners were planning meetings of a space station control board in late April or early May, and of the multilateral control board that governs the overall ISS partnership in June. “All of our international partners, including Roscosmos, are making progress moving towards station extension to 2030,” she said. “We all understand the importance of this continued partnership even in really, really tough times.”",

    "content": "SEOUL, South Korea —Japan’s space agency is set to recruit astronaut candidates for the first time in 13 years as part of efforts to support the NASA-led Artemis lunar exploration program.  The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) announced  the recruitment plan  Nov. 19, saying successful candidates would be assigned to work long-term at the International Space Station (ISS), the Japanese experiment module “Kibo” attached to ISS, or NASA’s lunar orbit outpost Gateway. JAXA,  under an agreement with NASA , is set to provide several capabilities for the Gateway’s International Habitation module (I-Hab), which will provide the heart of Gateway life support capabilities and additional space where crew will live, work, and conduct research during Artemis missions. “The working area is Earth and space. A business trip without a family to the International Space Station or a long trip to a base on the lunar surface is possible,” JAXA said. The agency said it would receive applications from Dec. 20 to March 4, 2022. Applicants will go through multiple tests and interviews — including ones evaluating English proficiency, leadership, problem-solving ability and ability to convey experiences of their missions to the public — with final candidates expected to be announced in February 2023, according to JAXA. According to the agency’s guidelines, applications must be Japanese citizens with normal vision, hearing and color perception, and have a minimum three years of work experience. They also have to be between 149.5 and 190.5 centimeters tall, due to specifications of spacecraft, spacesuit and other factors. Convicted offenders or those associated with extremist groups and parties are not allowed to participate in the competition. In the past, it was necessary for applicants to have a four-year university degree in the field of natural science, but JAXA has dropped such requirements, according to  a NHK report . JAXA plans to launch a campaign to encourage women to apply, as there are no active female astronauts in Japan. There have been 11 Japanese astronauts so far. Of them, seven men remain in service, with an average age of 52 as of November, according to NHK.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON — Virgin Galactic announced June 22 it has signed an agreement with NASA to support development of a program to train and potentially procure rides for private individuals seeking to fly to the International Space Station. The company, best known for developing the SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane, said it signed a Space Act Agreement with the Johnson Space Center to develop a “private orbital astronaut readiness program.” That initiative would support renewed efforts by NASA, announced a little more than a year ago, to increase commercial use of the station, including visits by private astronauts. As envisioned by Virgin Galactic, that program will handle various aspects of flying private individuals to the station. That would include identifying potential customers, handling training and arranging for transportation to the station. The company didn’t disclose details about those plans, including a schedule for beginning such flights or their costs. It’s unlikely that, in this scenario, Virgin Galactic would use its own vehicles for transporting people to and from the station. SpaceShipTwo is capable of only suborbital flight, and the company’s published long-term plans focus on high-speed point-to-point transportation rather than orbital human spaceflight. The company would more likely work with Boeing and SpaceX, the companies developing commercial crew vehicles for accessing the ISS. Both companies have shown interest in working with third parties rather than sell seats to individuals directly. SpaceX has already sold commercial flights of its Crew Dragon spacecraft to Axiom Space for a mission to the station as well as to Space Adventures for a standalone mission to an orbit higher to than the station. Space Adventures previously announced plans to partner with Boeing to market commercial Starliner flights. The arrangement, though, could make use of Virgin Galactic’s existing vehicles and infrastructure. The company said those capabilities “could play an important role in the training for orbital travel,” such as flying people to give them experience with microgravity and the G-forces of launch. The company would also use its facilities at Spaceport America in New Mexico for other aspects of training. “We are excited to partner with NASA on this private orbital spaceflight program, which will not only allow us to use our spaceflight platform, but also offer our space training infrastructure to NASA and other agencies,” George Whitesides, chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said in a statement. The agreement fits into  a broader low Earth orbit commercialization effort the agency announced last June , seeking to stimulate commercial use of the ISS and eventual development of commercial stations. That initiative includes a new commercial use policy for the station and price list for commercial use of ISS resources, as well as allowing private astronaut missions to the station. The strategy also included a competition to award access to a docking port on the station for a commercial module. In January,  the agency selected Axiom Space to use that port  for a module that the company plans to launch in the second half of 2024. That module will serve as a node for a series of future commercial modules that will eventually undock from the ISS and become a standalone space station. That strategy, though, has faced challenges, including a lack of funding. NASA requested $150 million for its LEO commercialization effort last year but received just a tenth of that amount from Congress. NASA is again seeking $150 million for LEO commercialization in its fiscal year 2021 budget proposal. NASA is also  revamping its LEO commercialization strategy . Doug Loverro, at the time the associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said in April that he planned to establish a single organization within its mission directorate that handled all commercial activities, including its commercial cargo and crew programs, in order to better manage them. That reorganization, though, appears to be on hold after Loverro abruptly resigned from the agency last month amid rumors of violating procurement regulations for the agency’s lunar lander program. This Space Act Agreement between NASA and Virgin Galactic is not the first agreement between the two organizations. Virgin Galactic has a contract from NASA’s Flight Opportunities program to carry research payloads on SpaceShipTwo flights. The company has several other Space Act Agreements to support research and development work,  including one announced May 5 to assist its work on future high-speed transportation systems . A future area of cooperation may involve flying NASA astronauts on SpaceShipTwo. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine announced March 2 that  the agency would start an effort to certify commercial suborbital vehicles , like SpaceShipTwo, so that astronauts could fly on them for training or research. Bridenstine, in a June 19 tweet, said  a request for information to support that effort would be released within a week . “This is big news,” Whitesides said in  a tweet responding to Bridenstine . “We look forward to working with the agency to advance this exciting capability to fly NASA astronauts.”"

    "content": "WASHINGTON — NASA is taking the next small step in its efforts to promote commercialization of low Earth orbit by flying a cosmetics company’s product to the International Space Station, a project that has prompted questions from one senator. Among the payloads on a Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo spacecraft launching to the ISS Sept. 29 are 10 bottles of a face cream by Estée Lauder. The bottles will be photographed in the cupola of the station, with the Earth as a backdrop, and the company will use the images in social media campaigns. “You may be asking why a beauty company is interested in sending our product to the International Space Station,” said Stéphane de la Faverie, group president of The Estée Lauder Companies and global brand president of Estée Lauder, during a Sept. 24 NASA media briefing about various payloads on the Cygnus mission. “We are always looking for the next frontier or breakthrough,” he explained. “We are really incredibly inspired by the work NASA is doing to push the boundaries of space exploration, and we saw a lot of synergy between both our brands’ commitment to science and innovation.” De la Faverie said that the images will be used as part of “an exciting story that we are building to share with followers as we take them on a journey into space.” He didn’t elaborate on the nature of the story. The bottles will be returned to Earth next spring, and the company may auction one of them for charity. NASA astronauts will photograph the cosmetics in the cupola, said Phil McAlister, director of commercial spaceflight development at NASA, but not appear in the images. The astronauts also won’t receive any additional compensation for that work. Estée Lauder will pay NASA approximately $128,000 for transporting the bottles to and from the station and conducting the photography. The Estée Lauder payload is part of a broader effort by NASA to support commercialization of LEO as it seeks to eventually transition from the ISS to commercial space stations. Part of that initiative,  announced in June 2019 , reserves 5% of NASA ISS resources for use on commercial projects, like this one. “In order for those destinations to be sustainable,” he said of commercial space stations, “they’re going to need customers other than NASA to support their operation. This Estée Lauder payload is one part of NASA’s overall strategy to help making that transition and to help commercial LEO development.” But sending bottles of face cream to the ISS has led to some wrinkled brows on Capitol Hill. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), ranking member of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, raised questions about the project during a Sept. 23 hearing on NASA’s fiscal year 2021 budget proposal. “I’m a fan of Estée Lauder’s Advanced Night Repair, like anybody else who might want to benefit from its antigravity properties,” she said of the face cream. “I guess I’m having trouble understanding how Estée Lauder’s effort is going to support the commercialization efforts of NASA.” She argued that the $128,000 the company will pay NASA will be just a fraction of the overall cost of the project. “Can you talk about how shooting a cosmetics commercial advances NASA’s mission?” she asked NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. Bridenstine said he wasn’t familiar with the project. “I don’t think that shooting a cosmetics commercial is the intent of that particular mission,” he said. However, neither McAlister nor de la Faverie discussed any additional aspects of the project beyond the photo shoot in the cupola that will be used for marketing by the company. McAlister said that the proposal from Estée Lauder was reviewed by NASA officials to determine if it met the criteria for being flown on the ISS as part of the LEO commercialization initiative. He said the proposal met the requirement that it “support the development of a sustainable LEO economy” and thus deemed eligible to fly. The fact that Estée Lauder is a nontraditional user of the station is a benefit in NASA’s view. “We need many businesses thinking of unique and innovative ways to expand economic activity in space,” he said. “We also think there’s value from a large, well-known company, such as Estée Lauder, being among the first companies taking advantage of our commercial use policy.” McAlister said several other proposals for commercial use of the ISS are being evaluated, including an agreement NASA signed recently that he said the agency would discuss in the near future. “This is a pathfinder, but I think this has definitely raised awareness, and we’re going to see more interest, we hope, in the future.” “We don’t know how exactly this is going to play out,” he said. “We need lots of people thinking of different things to do in space, and the fact that this was a surprise to so many people, I think, speaks directly to that point.”"

    "content": "NEW YORK — Two space station astronauts hit pay dirt in orbit Aug. 16 after successfully replacing a vital pump to restore their spacecraft’s cooling system, which had been limping along at half-power for more than two weeks. Astronauts Douglas Wheelock and Tracy Caldwell Dyson wired a bulky ammonia pump the size of a kitchen oven into the right side of the space station during the hours-long spacewalk. It was the third spacewalk for the astronauts to make the tricky repair 354 kilometers above Earth. A fourth spacewalk eventually will be needed to clean up some final work, but is not pressing, mission managers said. “It was a lot of hard work today, and hopefully we’ll have a pump up and running and be back in business on the space station,” Wheelock said as the spacewalk ended. Mission Control used remote commands to start filling the pump with liquid ammonia. By Aug. 19, the coolant system was back on line, allowing the crew to restart science equipment and other systems that had to be shut down for more than two weeks. The space station’s cooling system had been running at half-strength since July 31, when an electrical short shut down one of two pumps that move liquid ammonia through the system. The failure forced astronauts to turn off some experiments and systems, as well as leave others without backups, in order to prevent the station from overheating. Scientific research was stalled as well. NASA station managers have said the ammonia pump failure has been one of the most challenging repairs for the international space station. The cooling system is so critical to station operations that a pump repair is one of 14 major failures for which NASA engineers have prepared emergency plans, they added. While the space station crew tackled the problem in space, a team of engineers and astronauts on Earth worked round-the-clock to come up with the repair plans. It took two spacewalks just to remove the broken pump from its housing. That disabled pump is parked in a temporary spot and must be moved to its final perch on a spare parts platform in yet another spacewalk. There are four spare ammonia pumps on the space station, one of which was used for this repair. Each pump weighs 353 kilograms and is 1.6 meters long by 1.2 meters wide. The replacement pump used Aug. 16 was delivered in 2006. The spacewalk began at 6:20 a.m. EDT, about 35 minutes ahead of schedule. The astronauts swiftly tackled their first chore: removing the new pump from a spare-parts platform on the station’s exterior. “You know, when you’re on the [spare-parts platform] looking down at the Earth like this, it’s like extreme hang gliding,” Caldwell Dyson said. One of four bolts securing the pump in place gave Wheelock some trouble when it did not budge, but some extra elbow grease and tools did the trick. After that, the astronauts hooked up five power cables and four liquid ammonia hoses. They saw no major leaks of the toxic coolant like those seen on the earlier spacewalks. There are two main cooling system loops — Loop A and Loop B. The failed pump is in Loop A, while the other cooling loop remains operational. The broken pump was delivered to the space station in 2002 and was activated in 2006. The $100 billion international space station is currently home to six astronauts; three Americans and three Russians. Spare parts are a key concern since the station is slated to keep flying through at least 2020. NASA plans to fly two more shuttle missions (in November of this year and February 2011) before retiring its three remaining space shuttles. A potential extra shuttle flight, which would launch next summer if approved, is under discussion in Congress. Once the space shuttle fleet is retired, NASA will rely on spacecraft from Russia to launch crews and cargo to the space station until American-built commercial spaceships or new government vehicles become available. Unmanned cargo ships built by the Japanese and European space agencies are also expected to keep the station stocked with supplies. The spacewalk Aug. 16 was the sixth career spacewalk for Wheelock and the third for Caldwell Dyson. It was also the 150th spacewalk dedicated to space station assembly and maintenance. The space station has been under construction since 1998 by 15 countries and five different space agencies."

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/42294dummy-astronaut-shows-iss-crew-better-protected-from-radiation-than/",
    "content": "PARIS — A decade-long experiment using a human-like mannequin to assess radiation absorption inside and outside the international space station has concluded that the human body is much better at protecting astronaut internal organs than previously thought. The experiments, which used U.S. technology monitored by U.S., Russian, Japanese and European teams, conclude that previous radiation-intake measures, mainly dosimeters worn by astronauts in their pockets or on their chests, overstate the radiation exposure to internal organs. For an astronaut working inside the space station, the overestimate was about 15 percent — a fairly close correlation given that the station’s exterior shell provides much of the protection needed. But for astronauts working outside the station, the radiation absorption measured was substantially less than what had been registered by the personal dosimeters worn by astronauts. “Measurements of a personal dosimeter dramatically overstate the exposure of an astronaut, in the worst case by a factor of three,” according to a summary of the results by a Euro-Russian team. “[I]n an outside exposure the self-shielding of the human body is very effective. … [T]he effective dose equivalent is less than 30 percent higher than in an inside exposure.” The results were published recently in Radiation and Environmental Biophysics, published by Springer Group. “The result is important for planning long-term missions: It means that you can fly farther and fly longer,” Vyacheslav Shurshakov of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Biomedical Problems said in an Oct. 21 statement. Shurshakov cautioned that the results should not be used to minimize the risk to astronauts on long-term missions beyond Earth orbit, such as to Mars. “Even with these data, possible radiation doses for travelers to Mars is still too high … which creates an unnecessarily high risk of cancer. Experts have to look for ways to reduce the radiation dose or reduce the period of the flight.” Orbiting at about 400 kilometers in altitude and inclined 51.6 degrees relative to the equator, the space station is subject to radiation levels that have been estimated at 100 times the exposure at sea level. The experiments, called Matroshka, used a Rando mannequin provided by The Phantom Laboratory of Salem, New York. Rando is a human-skeleton torso padded with polyurethane to simulate soft human tissue and muscles. Other materials said to be “radiologically equivalent” to human organs were used for the lungs, brain, thyroid, pancreas, liver, colon, testicles and other organs. The 84-centimeter-high, 40-centimeter-wide and 22-centimeter-deep Rando was crisscrossed with 1,634 detectors. Rando comes in male and female versions; the one used was male. The Mastroshka facility was designed for the 20-nation European Space Agency by the German Aerospace Center, DLR. The Rando mannequin was placed outside the station for a year, to simulate radiation exposure by an astronaut performing an extravehicular activity. During its time outside, it was inside an airtight, carbon-fiber container built to approximate the radiation absorption of an astronaut’s spacesuit. A similar experiment had been used in the U.S. space shuttle in 1989 but it was never placed outside the shuttle.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/in-space-and-cyber-china-is-closing-in-on-the-united-states/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It should be no surprise that China is moving to challenge the United States for dominance in space, cyber, artificial intelligence and other key technologies that have wide national security applications. But the question that is still being debated is whether the United States is taking this threat seriously. This may not be a Sputnik moment, but the United States could soon be unpleasantly surprised as China continues to shore up its domestic capacity to produce high-end weapons, satellites and encryption technologies, a panel of analysts told the House Armed Services emerging threats and capabilities subcommittee. At the Tuesday hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said lawmakers are not entirely convinced that China\u2019s dominance in many technology sectors is a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d But the committee does believe that China\u2019s technological accomplishments should inform U.S. policies and defense investments. \u201cChina continues to increase their research and development investments at an alarming pace and is rapidly closing many of their technology gaps,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cMore and more, we see China using only domestic Chinese firms and creating high market access barriers to support domestic capacity.\u201d This has obvious national security implications, she said, \u201cshould they corner the market on advanced technologies critical to national security.\u201d There are strict laws and regulatory barriers in place to prevent China from accessing U.S. technology and from acquiring American companies. Fear of Chinese theft of space technology has shaped some of the most stringent U.S. export control policies. But China nonetheless has built up a significant satellite manufacturing industry, and has managed to develop quantum communications spacecraft with advanced encryption features. \u201cChina\u2019s satellite manufacturing industry is growing at an alarming rate,\u201d said Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Co. \u201cIn the past two years Chinese factories have pumped out 40 satellites.\u201d The government there subsidizes launch costs to prop up its state-owned entities, he said. \u201cThis in turn places our own satellite manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d Lamborn included a provision in last year\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act that bans the procurement of satellite communication by the U.S. government if such systems use satellites or components designed or manufactured by China. Dean Cheng, senior research fellow with the Asia Study Center at the Heritage Foundation, said China is filling global market needs for cheaper satellites. Countries like Nigeria, Bolivia and Venezuela are able to buy satellites \u201cfor a price that frankly no country can really compete with,\u201d said Cheng. \u201cThe question is whether Intelsat and Eutelsat are going to necessarily buy a satellite from Boeing if the Chinese can offer a satellite of relatively comparable capability for a purely commercial purpose.\u201d China also is poised to become a major player in the burgeoning small-satellite sector, Cheng said. \u201cWe expect to see the Chinese start moving into that arena. These are areas that will potentially constitute revolutionary capabilities and the Chinese recognize that it\u2019s important to play there.\u201d The exploitation of data from space will be a booming business for China, he said. \u201cThe Chinese are almost certainly going to be offering data as they deploy constellations,\u201d Cheng added. \u201cWe should expect to see them offering data at very competitive rates, potential undercutting prices to a variety of users.\u201d William Carter, a fellow at the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the United States\u2019 best hope to stay ahead of China in space lies in the commercial sector. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a huge amount of innovation happening in the United States in the private sector,\u201d he said. The free market is \u201cdriving them to innovate and find ways to cut cost and deliver better capabilities,\u201d Carter said. \u201cSo I think there may be room to do more to combat China \u2026 but I would also say that there\u2019s probably more reason for optimism about the U.S. commercial space sector today than there has been in a while.\u201d Whereas in the past China has put more emphasis on legal and illegal acquisition of technology, it is now developing technology on its own, Cheng said, \u201cwhich means both a reduced time lag and a greater ability of China to set the very terms of the technology debate.\u201d When the Chinese talk about improving information gathering, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about just cyber, we are talking about space capabilities including countering potential adversaries through things like anti-satellite weapons as well as jamming.\u201d Unlike the United States, China\u2019s centralized government can more easily spin in private sector innovations into the military, noted Paul Scharre, senior fellow with the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security. China has set a goal to be the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030 and will have major advantages in translating these private sector gains into national security applications. Stefanik said these development should be a wakeup call for the U.S. government. For years partisan divisions have stalled federal funding for key technology programs and the appropriations process is essentially broken. \u201cChina\u2019s leadership appears to recognize the connection between the development of many of these advanced technologies and economic growth. This is something we should remind ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps it is a lesson we need to relearn amidst our debates on sequestration and continuing resolutions.\u201d There is hope on Capitol Hill that the re-establishment of the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering will move the Pentagon\u2019s technology efforts in a different direction. \u201cI firmly believe that the undersecretary for R&E needs to be the prime mover to drive change and foster innovation within the department,\u201d said Stefanik. The undersecretary for R&E will be in a \u201cunique position to drive a national-level dialogue for science and technology policy,\u201d she noted. \u201cSo therefore we have significant expectations of Dr. Mike Griffin, the nominee to be undersecretary for research and engineering.\u201d Stefanik insisted that the \u201cthreats we face from China and others demand that we energize and organize our government to ensure that policy keeps pace with technology.\u201d",

A constellation of 100 to 200 radio occultation satellites, which provide detailed observations of atmospheric temperature and moisture, could be used in conjunction with geostationary weather satellites like  NOAA\u2019s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16  to dramatically improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of global weather prediction models, MacDonald said. Spire is building one satellite per week in its factory in Scotland, but could produce its three-unit cubesats more quickly. \u201cI think we could turn them out at two or three or five per week,\u201d MacDonald said. Spire also is expanding its ground network. The company has 27 ground stations operating and is pushing to increase that number to 50 because the added ground stations will allow the firm to provide customers with data no more than 30 minutes old, MacDonald said. In addition to using its spacecraft for meteorology,  Spire\u2019s cubesats carry Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) payloads for aircraft tracking and Automatic Identification System (AIS) payloads for maritime tracking . \u201cWe collect about 10 million ship reports a day,\u201d MacDonald said.",

    "title": "Scientists and engineers push for servicing and assembly of future space observatories",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/scientists-and-engineers-push-for-servicing-and-assembly-of-future-space-observatories/",
    "content": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 A group of astronomers and engineers is seeking to convince NASA to study in-space servicing and assembly of future space telescopes, including the role the proposed Deep Space Gateway could play to support it. During a panel discussion at the 231st Meeting of the American Astronomical Society here, members of an ad-hoc group formed last year to study the topic argued that servicing and assembly techniques, involving astronauts or robots, could enable both servicing of telescopes to extend their lives as well as assemble future observatories too large to launch in a single piece. NASA has taken very different approaches to servicing for its flagship space telescopes. At one extreme is the Hubble Space Telescope, which was repaired and upgraded on five shuttle servicing missions between 1993 and 2009, allowing the telescope to overcome initial problems and improve its performance. \u201cWhen Hubble was launched in 1990, it was not a very good telescope,\u201d said John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who flew on three of those shuttle servicing missions and later served as the agency\u2019s associate administrator for science. \u201cHad it not been serviceable, we would have long ago abandoned it.\u201d The James Webb Space Telescope is at the other extreme, with no capability for servicing. Once launched, the spacecraft will go through a complex sequence to unfold its mirror and deploy a large sunshield, all without the ability for an astronaut or a robotic spacecraft to fix anything should that deployment go awry. \u201cOnce we launch it, James Webb will start, on its own, doing all of these deployments by commands,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one is up there to give it a little shake if anything sticks.\u201d To drive that point home, Grunsfeld displayed a slide. \u201cThis is the full description of the James Webb Space Telescope servicing plans,\u201d he said. The slide was blank. While JWST is not designed for servicing \u2014 Grunsfeld said it might be possible, but risky, to do some kind of robotic refueling mission for the telescope about 10 years after launch \u2014 the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the next flagship mission after JWST, will have some support for robotic servicing. Adding latches and modular interfaces for such servicing increases the cost of WFIRST only slightly, he said, and those costs can be recovered by savings during integration and test. The group is also working to convince the teams working on four ongoing studies of large mission concepts for space observatories, intended to support the next decadal survey for astrophysics to be completed in 2020, that they should incorporate in-space servicing or assembly technologies. \u201cSome of the teams are very receptive, and others are just pedaling as fast as they can to get some of their concept studies done prior to the decadal,\u201d Grunsfeld said. Representatives of all the mission design teams were at a November meeting to discuss servicing and assembly technologies, he added. \u201cSome of them hadn\u2019t considered any kind of serviceability. I think we actually opened their eyes\u201d to concepts like making instruments modular and easily replaced. NASA\u2019s proposed Deep Space Gateway, a human-tended outpost in cislunar space, could also support servicing and assembly of space telescopes, serving as a base of operations for astronauts working on such spacecraft. \u201cIf that comes about, it would certainly make a huge advance to assembling them in space,\u201d said Ronald Polidan of Polidan Science Systems and Technology. Polidan said that the group, at its November meeting, suggested that NASA work with industry and academia to study the roles the Gateway could play in assembly and servicing of observatories. That needs to be done in the near future, he said, in order to ensure that any specific requirements for those activities are incorporated into the overall requirements of the Gateway, as well as ensure the Gateway design does not preclude such work. Whether or not the Deep Space Gateway is used for building and repairing space telescopes, Polidan and others argued that in-space assembly will ultimately be needed as the research demands by astronomers lead to observatories too large to be launched from the ground, and perhaps too expensive as well. Polidan said that the largest telescopes that could be launched by current and upcoming vehicles, including the Space Launch System, have apertures of no more than about 15 meters. Some of the concepts under study for the 2020 decadal are that large. \u201cThe launch vehicle \u2018wall\u2019 is imminent,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter this next round of telescopes, more likely than not what we would like to fly will not fit in a single launch.\u201d Servicing, he added, can extend the lives of space telescopes and upgrade their instruments, as was the case with Hubble, making them more cost-effective in the long run. \u201cYou now have the equivalent of a ground-based observatory, that you can upgrade and change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is now a facility rather than one you have to build, throw away, and build again.\u201d \u201cThe James Webb Space Telescope is incredibly audacious, and it\u2019s going to be amazing. For many of you, it\u2019s going to be your future in astronomy,\u201d Grunsfeld said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Are we going to go small because we\u2019re afraid of asking for too much money, or afraid of risk, or are we going to go big and keep at the forefront of scientific research?\u201d",

    "content": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2013 The U.S. Air Force is seeking continuous improvement of its ability to understand and forecast space weather that impacts Defense Department satellites, said Ralph Stoffler, Air Force director of weather. \u201cThis is an important business area which will continue to expand over the next several years,\u201d Stoffler said Jan. 9 at the American Meteorological Society meeting here. \u201cWe are going to throw more resources at this and get this capability up to where it needs to be.\u201d Much of that work involves partnerships. In 2017, the Air Force established a pilot program to evaluate whether commercial providers could provide valuable space weather data. \u201cWe fully expect to go down the pathway of buying commercial data, both space-based and terrestrial, to improve our forecasts,\u201d Stoffler said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely in the cards and that\u2019s what we are going to need.\u201d The Air Force also is expanding international partnerships. \u201cWorking together is key,\u201d Stoffer said. \u201cWe are working hot and heavy with NATO partners in particular and with a number of folks in Asia.\u201d An inherent challenge with all aspects of the space weather mission is cybersecurity. The Air Force relies on a combination of old and new observing systems scattered around the world. \u201cOne of the reasons we are not as far along as we should be in this area is because cybersecurity is a big deal,\u201d Stoffler said. \nCloud computing may help. Commercial data providers often move their data into clouds with built-in cybersecurity. The Air Force could then pull data from those clouds into its processing centers. \u201cThat will be the future,\u201d Stoffler said. \u201cWe look to using the cloud to make that happen.\u201d The Air Force also plans to install an Energetic Charged Particle (ECP) sensor on its spacecraft. A prototype of the new ECP sensor is undergoing testing and the Air Force plans anticipates full operational capability in 2023, Stoffler said. The space weather mission is becoming increasingly important as the U.S. military expands its reliance on satellites for communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. All of those missions \u201crely on space capability and if the space stuff doesn\u2019t work, you are in serious straits,\u201d Stoffler said.",

    "title": "Camera focus shift won\u2019t affect TESS mission",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/camera-focus-shift-wont-affect-tess-mission/",
    "content": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 Scientists are confident a focus issue discovered last year with an upcoming NASA exoplanet mission won\u2019t affect its ability to meet its goals. NASA confirmed last July that the focus in the four cameras on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) would drift once the cameras cool after launch to operating temperatures. At the time, the agency said that it believed that the issue would not be a major issue for the mission, although other astronomers expressed concern it could affect the spacecraft\u2019s ability to detect exoplanets. Additional testing and analysis since then has given those involved with the mission greater confidence that they understand the focus issue and that it won\u2019t adversely affect the mission\u2019s science. \u201cSubsequent testing that we did starting this summer and then into the fall indicated that there is a model\u201d for explaining the focus change, said George Ricker, principal investigator for TESS at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, during a briefing about the mission during the 231st Meeting of the American Astronomical Society here Jan. 9. \u201cThis is a very reproducible crystallization effect for one of the materials used to manufacture the lenses.\u201d Ricker said the mission did four months of testing on a flight spare camera to understand long-term focus effects. Those tests show that the focus of the camera drifts for about one week, then stops. \u201cThere\u2019s essentially no measurable change after that,\u201d he said, calling the issue a one-time \u201cfocus shift\u201d rather than a more continuous \u201cfocus drift.\u201d That focus shift, he said, won\u2019t affect the ability of TESS to meet its primary, or \u201cLevel One,\u201d science requirements, which call for eventually measuring the mass of at least 50 planets similar in size to the Earth. The mission\u2019s primary focus on photometry \u2014 measuring very small changes in brightness of stars as orbiting planets transit, or cross in front, of them \u2014 also minimizes the importance of a sharp focus. \u201cThis is a photometry mission, not an imaging mission,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat this means is that it\u2019s not important to have a sharp focus across the entire field of view. This was never part of the design. But it is important that the focus be stable, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been able to establish.\u201d Ricker said there are no other issues for TESS, currently completing assembly and testing at an Orbital ATK facility in Virginia. The spacecraft is scheduled to ship to the Kennedy Space Center in early February for final launch preparations. TESS will launch no earlier than March 20 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 into an elliptical orbit that is in a 2:1 resonance with the moon. That orbit, Ricker said, is very stable and also allows for high data rates from the spacecraft. That limits the days on which TESS can launch in order to phase into the proper trajectory. Ricker said there were about 40 days through June on which TESS could launch. The four cameras on TESS will map nearly the entire sky over its two-year primary mission. Astronomers expect that TESS will detect thousands of exoplanets, many of which will be ideal for follow-up observations by other telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, to characterize them. TESS has also attracted interest from other astronomers interested in using spacecraft data for other research. Padi Boyd, director of the guest investigator program for TESS at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, said at the briefing that there was a very strong response to a first call for proposals to participate on the mission, with scientists proposing to use TESS data for topics ranging from other exoplanet studies to stellar astrophysics and extragalactic astronomy. \u201cWe were very excited to see how the broader scientific community really responded to this opportunity,\u201d she said, adding that the initial set of guest investigations will be announced in about a month. While TESS has a two-year primary mission, Ricker said he believed that the spacecraft could operate for much longer. The stability of its orbit, he said, requires no stationkeeping, and hence minimizes the need to use its thrusters. \u201cThe operational life of the mission could very well extend for more than two decades,\u201d he said.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/sn-military-space-what-happened-to-zuma-budget-standoff-continues-big-week-for-orbital-atk/",
    "content": "You\u2019re reading the SN Military.Space newsletter we publish Tuesdays. If you would like to get our news and insights for military space professionals before everyone else,  sign up here for your free subscription .  Something appears to have gone seriously wrong with the secret government mission, code-named Zuma, that SpaceX launched Sunday night. Exactly what, however, is far from clear. But if SpaceX keeps launching in the days and weeks ahead, we will be fairly sure Falcon 9 isn\u2019t to blame for what went wrong. The Wall Street Journal,  citing unnamed industry and government officials, reported late Monday that the payload \u201cis presumed to be a total loss after it failed to reach orbit atop a [SpaceX] rocket.\u201d  Many took that to mean SpaceX\u2019s first outing of 2018 was a bust. SpaceX, however, says Falcon 9 performed as expected during the classified mission and several independent analysts corroborate that assertion. Nobody at the Pentagon or at Northrop Grumman \u2014 which provided the payload and its adapter \u2014 would comment, citing the sensitivity of the classified mission. SpaceX President and COO  Gwynne Shotwell  put out a statement Tuesday saying Falcon 9\u2019s part of the mission went off as planned. \u201cAfter review of all the data to data, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on Sunday night,\u201d she said. And she noted that any reports that the rocket failed are \u201ccategorically false.\u201d Shotwell said preparations for SpaceX\u2019s upcoming launches remain unchanged, another suggestion SpaceX doesn\u2019t have concerns about its rocket\u2019s performance Sunday. \u201cFalcon Heavy has been rolled out to launchpad LC-39A for a static fire later this week, to be followed shortly thereafter by its maiden flight. We are also preparing for an F9 launch for SES and the Luxembourg Government from SLC-40 in three weeks.\u201d \u201cI think we will know if it was an issue with the Falcon 9 because SpaceX would need to delay other launches to look into the issue,\u201d Space expert  Todd Harrison  of the Center for Strategic and International Studies tweeted Tuesday. Satellite tracker  Marco Langbroek posted an image  of a spectacular green-blue \u201cspiral\u201d taken by an airline pilot that \u201calmost certainly\u201d shows the Falcon 9 upper stage dumping fuel about 2 hours and 15 minutes after launch and prior to its planned reentry, suggesting nominal Falcon performance. Space analyst  Brian Weeden  of the Secure World Foundation said \u201cthe most plausible explanation based on what we know is that the upper stage and payload didn\u2019t separate fully, and the fuel dump/de-orbit burn by the upper stage either brought it back down, or put it in an orbit that\u2019s too low.\u201d \u201cWe know the [18th Space Control Squadron] did indeed catalog an object from the launch, which they say was the payload,\u201d Weeden told  SpaceNews . \u201cSo unless that was itself a big mistake, something ended up in orbit for at least a brief period of time. And according to the 18 SPCS, that object is still on orbit (it hasn\u2019t been marked \u201cdecayed\u201d yet), although again they might not be as quick to make that change for a classified payload.\u201d Jonathan McDowell , an astronomer who tracks satellite launches, made similar points, noting that the goverment\u2019s Space-Track orbital registry lists Zuma as USA 280 and gives it a formal catalog number, suggesting it spent at least a short time in orbit. \u201cConflicts with [Wall Street Journal] story that payload failed to separate from second stage (which is believed to have deorbited itself),\u201d McDowell tweeted Monday. \u201cConsistent with SpaceX claim that rocket behaved correctly.\u201d McDowell, like Weeden, said it\u2019s plausible Falcon 9\u2019s second stage reentered as planned after 1.5 orbits, unaware that the payload was still attached. While that would normally point to a SpaceX problem, McDowell noted \u2014  as has been reported elsewhere  \u2014 that Northrop Grumman  \u201cprovided its own payload adapter, so separation may be [Northrop Grumman\u2019s] problem and not SpaceX\u2019s problem.\u201d Those of us without the proper clearances may never know what happened to Zuma, but if SpaceX doesn\u2019t break cadence in the weeks ahead, we\u2019ll at least be reasonably sure Falcon 9 isn\u2019t to blame. As for those inclined to believe this whole incident is just an elaborate smoke screen, McDowell has an answer for that, too: \u201cI see a lot of people suggesting that the loss of Zuma is a front, a cover to hide a successful insertion in a secret orbit or some other scam. This is JUST NOT PLAUSIBLE for many reasons. I am confident other experts on the subject will agree with me.\u201d Budget standoff continues, defense buildup delayed again The Pentagon and the rest of the federal government are still waiting for Congress to pass a budget for fiscal year 2018. Meanwhile, DoD is finishing up the initial draft request for fiscal year 2019. If you recall a year ago, we were hearing about a big military spending surge coming in 2019 and that 2018 would be a transition year for the Pentagon to recover from the Obama-era cuts. Oh well, that timeline quickly was derailed by partisan fights and internal divisions in the GOP over spending priorities. The latest word from  Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan  is that there will be a big increase, but in 2020. Defense industry insider  James McAlees e says Pentagon and its contractors should continue to hang on to hopes of a buildup as long as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is in charge. His \u201cpersonal credibility and charisma\u201d help on Capitol Hill, McAleese says. \u201cAny sudden departure of Secretary Mattis would definitely slow the growth trajectory of 2019-2023 defense funding.\u201d Will space programs see a boost? Unclear for now. \u201cIndustry CEOs have strong insight into immediate USAF programs [like the F-35, the B-21 bomber] but have very limited insights\u201d into longer term priorities such as laying the foundation for a future space corps, as Congress directed in the National Defense Authorization Act. Some hints about future space investments might surface later this month when the Pentagon unveils a new \u201cNational Defense Strategy.\u201d Mattis told reporters the strategy will be rolled out Jan. 19. Pentagon spokesman Col. Robert Manning said on Monday that the strategy was still \u201cin staffing,\u201d and that neither Mattis nor President Trump had yet approved it. Air Force acquisitions under new management News last week about the nomination of Pentagon procurement \u201cdisruptor\u201d Dr.  Will Roper  to be assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition stirred up speculation about how he might tackle space modernization. If confirmed, Roper stands to bring a new perspective to Air Force big-ticket acquisitions, including space systems. Roper founded the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cstrategic capabilities office\u201d to advance efforts to inject innovative technology into the military. He has criticized the Pentagon procurement bureaucracy for over-designing systems and building \u201cexquisite\u201d hardware instead of tapping less costly off-the-shelf commercial technology to update existing weapons. How Roper might steer the Air Force to use more commercial technology will be closely watched by the space industry, a sector where privately funded innovation is booming. The Air Force has been criticized for not taking advantage of the available technology \u2014 in launch, satellites, software and other areas \u2014 and integrating it more quickly into military space systems. Doing business with the Air Force: \u2018It\u2019s Hard\u2019 Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson was brutally candid  during a Q&A session Friday at a Washington Space Business Roundtable event. The government and the Air Force are \u201chard to work with\u201d and arcane procurement methods will continue to scare away many companies in the space and technology sectors that otherwise would consider jumping into the military market. \u201cI also know that a lot of small companies aren\u2019t going to work with us,\u201d Wilson said. She highlighted the remarkable achievements of startups like small-satellite maker Planet and low-cost launch provider Rocket Lab. The Air Force, however, intends to continue to produce military-unique satellites and launch vehicles because of its sensitive national security requirements. After our story was published, I heard from government contracting expert  Karri Palmetier  who advises small businesses in the Denver area. \u201cSecretary Wilson summed up the dichotomy facing the DoD and other government agencies,\u201d Palmetier said. \u201cReform is needed to allow innovation because DoD \u2018is hard to work with\u2019 but the military has unique needs. The trick will be to find ways to use, adapt, modify, and/or overhaul the acquisition system to find ways to adjust to each acquisition as appropriate. This also means an acquisition workforce that can is trained properly to handle the different processes.\u201d And oh by the way, \u201cIndustry loves to point fingers at the DoD being the cause of all the problems and the truth is not that simple.\u201d A huge week for Orbital ATK The company scored major deals over the past few days. Only months before Orbital ATK\u2019s first \u201cmission extension vehicle\u201d known as MEV-1 is scheduled to go to high orbit to service an aging Intelsat satellite,  the company signs an order for a second vehicle,  the MEV-2. Tom Wilson , president of Orbital ATK\u2019s Space Logistics subsidiary spoke with SpaceNews about the MEV-2 project and dropped hints about a new robotic vehicle the company will unveil in March at the Satellite 2018 trade show. Orbital yesterday also announced it received another Intelsat contract to build the Galaxy 30 communications satellite. The satellite will be based on Orbital\u2019s GEOStar-2 satellite platform. Galaxy 30 will be the 11th satellite Orbital ATK has built for Intelsat, and represents the first satellite in the Galaxy fleet replacement program. On the military business side, Orbital ATK last week reported it has signed a cooperative research and development agreement with the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems Center to continue work on the \u201cnext generation launch\u201d system.  Scott Lehr , president of Orbital ATK\u2019s Flight Systems Group said the company looks forward to certifying NGL to launch national security space missions. The next phase of the NGL program is expected to begin when the Air Force awards Launch Services Agreements in mid-2018. Orbital ATK, meanwhile, soon will be merged with Northrop Grumman Corp. Over time details will emerge on how both companies\u2019 space businesses will blend together. Northrop Grumman is said to have a growing classified space portfolio. One of these secret payloads was Zuma. Army nixes funding for Argos satellites General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems  announced last month that it received a contract from the Department of Defense Ordnance Technology Consortium for the Army Resilient Global on-the-move SATCOM, known as ARGOS. The small-satellite network was intended to provide Ultra High Frequency and Very High Frequency beyond line of sight communications and unattended ground sensor data capture capabilities for the U.S. Army. GA-EMS has successfully flown eleven satellites. But the project might be in danger as the Army decided to end its financial support after this year. Lira Frye, a spokeswoman for the Army Space and Missile Defense Command confirmed the budget for Argos was zeroed out for 2018. \u201cThe Army is moving in a different direction,\u201d Frye told  SpaceNews .

    "title": "On National Security | Cloud of uncertainty over military space programs",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/on-national-security-cloud-of-uncertainty-over-military-space-programs/",
    "content": "\u201cOn National Security\u201d appears in every issue of SpaceNews magazine. This column ran in the Dec. 18, 2017 issue. The U.S. military\u2019s ambitious space agenda faces big unknowns. Budgets top the list. Other looming issues are political and organizational. Despite a commitment by the U.S. Air Force to increase military space budgets by 20 percent, larger fiscal pressures may derail those plans. The GOP-dominated Congress and the Trump White House promised a big boost in military spending but so far that vision looks more like a mirage. Congress last week managed to keep the government open with temporary funding until Dec. 22 while lawmakers figure out the next steps. A bipartisan budget agreement will be needed to determine the final defense funding level but there are still many unresolved issues. If the GOP tax reform bill gets passed, analysts predict the government will be cash-strapped in the coming years even more so than it is now \u2014 a scenario that makes it unlikely that the nation can afford to spend more on the military or on costly space ventures. Budget uncertainty could hurt space programs even more so than other military priorities because space projects compete for funding with aviation procurements. \u201cAll those space programs that were going to start ramping up can\u2019t happen without a budget deal,\u201d budget analyst Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told me last week. The next-generation satellite programs that the Air Force has been trying to push forward are not scheduled to start production any time soon but they still need funding to continue development and testing. \u201cAbsolutely there will be pressure on space programs,\u201d he said. Harrison recalled that when he spoke with Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson in October, he asked her about the service\u2019s acquisition priorities. \u201cShe named a bunch of aircraft programs. There were no space progrxams in that list of priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cIf push comes to shove and they don\u2019t get all the resources they\u2019re looking for, I think the Air Force is going to focus on air power.\u201d The Air Force \u201cmust-fund\u201d items include the F-35A fighter jet, the B-21 bomber, the KC-46A tanker, the T-X trainer aircraft, a new intercontinental ballistic missile and a new nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile. In space, it\u2019s no so clear. The Air Force laid out plans to begin new programs for several satellite constellations, including a new missile-warning system, a modernized GPS, protected communications and wideband communications systems. If history is any guide, satellite procurements would be stretched out a few more years to free up funds for aviation. Adding more uncertainty is last week\u2019s enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018, which reorganizes the Pentagon\u2019s space responsibilities. The law shifts space-related organizational, training and equipping powers from the Air Force secretary and Air Force chief of staff to the Air Force Space Command. The current head of Space Command, Gen. John \u201cJay\u201d Raymond, said the reorganization will help set the conditions for the United States to get ahead of its enemies. The devil here will be in the details. The deputy secretary of defense has been assigned to lead the implementation of this law. The NDAA also directed the Pentagon to study the possibility of deploying a space-based missile defense system, a complex and costly technology that the U.S. military has not pursued since the Reagan administration\u2019s Star Wars initiative. The technological, fiscal and political implications of a space-based missile defense are significant. Arms control experts have warned such a system would be destabilizing. The NDAA suggests the Pentagon should aim for a \u201cboost phase\u201d interceptor which is the hardest to do from space, said Harrison. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a massive constellation of satellites to do that. If you run the numbers, it\u2019s probably over 1,000 satellites to be able to intercept ballistic missiles one at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a country launched two missiles from the same place at the same time you would need to double the size of your constellation.\u201d Congressional interest in a space-based missile defense, like Trump\u2019s military buildup talk, illustrate today\u2019s reality: Everyone has big lofty ambitions that are not supported by strategy, policy or budgets.

    "content": "Updated at 7:19 p.m. Eastern with additional information from ViaSat, Boeing and Harris Corp.  WASHINGTON \u2014 An on-orbit antenna issue identified during testing of the ViaSat-2 high-throughput satellite has Boeing and ViaSat searching for answers. Satellite operator ViaSat said Jan. 9 that the ViaSat-2 satellite launched in June to provide some 300 Gbps of throughput will need additional testing to find what\u2019s causing \u201csome spot beams to perform differently than they did during ground testing.\u201d Boeing, manufacturer of the ViaSat-2 satellite, is working with ViaSat to identify the problem and find a solution.  \u201cOur advanced ground network, coupled with the flexibility features of the ViaSat-2 satellite, will help us manage the impact from the identified antenna issue if needed,\u201d Mark Dankberg, ViaSat\u2019s chairman and CEO, said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to launching commercial service next month and bringing new higher-speed fixed and mobile services to market.\u201d ViaSat has been waiting on ViaSat-2 to provide fresh growth potential, building on the nearly oversubscribed ViaSat-1 satellite. Initial measurements suggest the antenna problem \u201cwill not impact the coverage area of the satellite, or materially impact the planned services and the expected financial results from the ViaSat-2 system,\u201d ViaSat said. Dankberg, during a Jan. 9 investor conference, said the malfunction is with \u201csome of the antennas,\u201d but did not quantify how many. ViaSat spokesperson Christina Phillips told  SpaceNews  the company doesn\u2019t disclose the number of antennas on ViaSat-2 for competitive reasons. Publicly released artist\u2019s renditions of the satellite differ from the actual design, she said.  \u201cIt is indicative of some kind of deployment-type of issue, which we are trying to address,\u201d Dankberg said. \u201cBut I think the overall positive message is we have so many elements of the system that have come together really well that we have more than enough maneuvering room to deal with that issue if it turns out that it can\u2019t be resolved in a better performance way.\u201d A Boeing spokesperson told  SpaceNews  the manufacturer \u201cintegrates the antenna subsystem with parts built by Boeing and our suppliers,\u201d and is \u201cnot able to disclose specific supplier names at this time.\u201d Harris Corp., a top supplier of antenna reflectors for commercial telecom satellites, deferred questions about ViaSat-2 to Boeing.  A February commercial service start date remains unchanged, ViaSat said, adding that demonstrations with consumer user terminals show internet downlink speeds exceeding 100 Mbps. Testing has also shown ViaSat-2\u2019s ground network of multiple small gateways \u2014 meant to boost throughput and ensure redundancy \u2014 is performing better than initially planned.  When ordered from Boeing in 2013, Dankberg described ViaSat-2 as having a unique spot beam design that had \u201cnever been done before.\u201d The satellite covers North America, the Caribbean, some of South America, and a swath of the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe frequented by aircraft and maritime vessels.",

    "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-pilot/",
    "content": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 NASA plans to begin awarding sole source contracts in March to companies flying small satellite constellations as part of an Earth science data pilot program. The purchase agreements will allow NASA \u201cto basically buy data by the yard,\u201d said Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of NASA\u2019s Earth Science division. In early December, NASA  issued a request for information  from companies currently flying constellations of at least three satellites to determine the types of data they are gathering. In response, the agency received 11 capability statements. Beginning next week, NASA plans to begin meeting with those companies to learn more about the constellations, find out how much it would cost to buy data and what type of data licensing the firms will permit, Cauffman said Jan. 8 during an American Meteorological Society conference panel here on NASA and NOAA\u2019s use of commercial weather and Earth science data. Unlike NOAA,  which is seeking to purchase weather data to share with its domestic and international partners , NASA plans initially to only share the data with researchers who can help the agency determine their value for Earth science. \u201cIf the we like what we see and the data is of value, we want to go ahead after the pilot and set up a different kind of contractual mechanism for data continuity,\u201d Cauffman said. When  NASA initially began investigating the market for Earth science data from small satellite constellations in 2016 , only five companies responded to the agency\u2019s request for information and only three of them proved capable of delivering data. \u201cThis time we have many more,\u201d Cauffman said. \u201cCompanies are popping up like crazy.\u201d Since the market is changing so rapidly, NASA plans to provide onramps for new data providers. \u201cWe are thinking every one or two years we will release another RFI to see who else is in the market,\u201d Cauffman said. \u201cWe want to encourage industry to talk to us if you have the intent to launch a constellation. We are interested consumers looking to purchase relevant data.\u201d Eventually, NASA may consider purchasing Earth science data from small satellite constellation operators outside the United States, but the initial pilot program will be limited to U.S. companies, Cauffman said.",

    "title": "NASA plans to have WFIRST reviews complete by April",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/nasa-plans-to-have-wfirst-reviews-complete-by-april/",
    "content": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 NASA hopes to have a major astronomy mission back on track by April after completing efforts to reduce its cost, an agency official said Jan. 8. Speaking at a meeting of astronomers prior to the start of the 231st Meeting of the American Astronomical Society here, Paul Hertz, director of NASA\u2019s astrophysics division, said the agency plans to hold a key review for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), known as Key Decision Point B, by April. WFIRST was the subject of an independent analysis that concluded in October that its cost was at least $3.6 billion. NASA, in response to that report, called on the project to \u201cdescope\u201d the mission to bring its cost down to a prior of estimate of $3.2 billion. Hertz said that, under the project\u2019s current schedule, there will be a system requirements review and mission design review in February, followed by an independent cost assessment. That will be followed by the Key Decision Point B review in March or April, which would allow the project to proceed into Phase B of its development. The biggest changes to WFIRST to lower its cost involve one of its instruments, a coronagraph. That instrument is designed to precisely block light from individual stars, allowing observations of planets or dust disks orbiting them. That instrument, he said, will now be considered a technology demonstration, and its cost will be shared with the agency\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate. \u201cTheir contribution, and international contributions, do not count against the $3.2 billion,\u201d he said. As a technology demonstration, Hertz said the coronagraph will have fewer science functions. It will, he said, remain \u201ca very valuable technology demonstration with feed forward into future direct imaging missions.\u201d The mission is also planning reductions for WFIRST\u2019s other main instrument, a wide-field instrument. Hertz said the instrument will have fewer operating modes and relaxed detector requirements, and some capabilities will be provided by unannounced international partners. Another change has been revisions to the overall project schedule, which allows for a launch about six months sooner than previously planned, saving money. However, he said the project will spend more money on \u201cmission assurance\u201d activities in response to a finding by last fall\u2019s independent review that argued the mission was taking on a higher risk profile than warranted for one of this size. Hertz said later that NASA is in discussions with five potential international partners for roles on WFIRST. \u201cEach of those partners is going through their own internal processes, so we\u2019re not announcing what we\u2019re assuming they will contribute until they\u2019re ready to say publicly that they have approval,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "White House resubmits NASA and NOAA nominations",
    "url": "https://spacenews.com/white-house-resubmits-nasa-and-noaa-nominations/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House formally resubmitted nominations for leaders of both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the Senate Jan. 8, a procedural move even as the path to their confirmations becomes narrower. The administration announced late Jan. 8 that the nominations of Jim Bridenstine to be administrator of NASA and Barry Myers to be administrator NOAA were being resubmitted to the Senate, along with several dozen other nominees for government positions. Also included in the list was Jeffrey DeWit, who was first nominated Nov. 29 to be chief financial officer of NASA. The resubmitted nominations are a procedural move. The Senate, under its rules, returns nominations to the president at the end of its first session if they have not been either confirmed or rejected by the full Senate, unless the Senate agrees by unanimous consent to keep the nominations active. The president must resubmit the nomination if he still wants the Senate to consider them. Both Bridenstine and Myers were pending consideration by the full Senate after party-line votes by the Senate Commerce Committee to advance their nominations, with all committee Republicans voting for the nominees and all committee Democrats voting against them. DeWit had not yet had a confirmation hearing by the committee before the Senate adjourned for the year Dec. 21.  The nominees return to a Senate where Republican control has become razor thin. Republicans now hold 51 seats after Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat, was sworn in Jan. 3 to take the seat previously held by interim Republican Sen. Luther Strange. Democrats now hold 49 seats, counting two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats. That narrow majority is unlikely to affect Myers\u2019 confirmation, as no Republicans have expressed opposition to the nomination. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, acknowledged at the committee\u2019s Dec. 13 vote to advance the nomination that it was likely Myers would ultimate be confirmed. \u201cIf Mr. Myers is confirmed \u2014 and I can count votes \u2014 this senator will do everything in the world, as will all of these senators,\u201d he said in a statement prior to the committee\u2019s vote, pointing to the other Democrats on the committee, \u201cto make him successful.\u201d The path to confirmation is less certain for Bridenstine. At least one Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, has publicly expressed reservations about Bridenstine\u2019s nomination, but has not announced if he would vote to confirm Bridenstine. With the current 51\u201349 split, only one Republican can oppose a nomination and still allow confirmation, with a 50\u201350 tie being broken by the vice president. Complicating those calculations is the uncertain health of two Republicans in the Senate, Thad Cochran of Mississippi and John McCain of Arizona. Cochran missed several weeks last fall with an illness, and McCain went home in December prior to the end of the session to recuperate from brain cancer treatments but is expected to return this month. Despite the uncertain support for Bridenstine in the Senate, industry continues to back his nomination to lead the space agency. \u201cFor us, this was an ideal candidate,\u201d said Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, in a Dec. 18 speech at the Next-Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference in Broomfield, Colorado. He cited Bridenstine\u2019s space policy experience as a member of the House of Representatives, working on civil, commercial and national security space issues, as a key factor. He acknowledged, though, the political factors that have complicated the confirmation process. \u201cThis has been the most unusual, awkward, weird presidential nomination I have ever seen, and certainly the likes that NASA has seen,\u201d he said, adding he hoped the Senate would finally take up the nomination by early this year. For now, Robert Lightfoot, NASA associate administrator, remains the agency\u2019s acting administrator. He had held that position for nearly one year, an unprecedented span in the agency\u2019s nearly 60-year history. Lightfoot has received widespread acclaim for his interim leadership of the agency, but even Lightfoot has said he\u2019d like to have a permanent administrator confirmed sooner rather than later. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun running the agency for a while, but I\u2019m ready for a boss,\u201d Lightfoot said in a Dec. 5 speech at the Space Commerce Conference and Exhibition in Houston. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get one here soon.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tekever, a Portugal-based company with business interests ranging from clean energy to defense and logistics, is pulling together a team of domestic companies and organizations to build the first made-in-Portugal satellite. That small satellite, called Infante, is a precursor to a constellation of 12 spacecraft in low-Earth orbit for remote sensing and telecommunications services.  The team\u2019s current plan is for Infante to be a 16U cubesat with a mass of 25 kilograms.  \u201cThe new microsatellite constellation will complement existing assets, both satellites, such as the Sentinels, and in-situ ones such as drones, in order to substantially enhance Earth observation and communications services, primarily targeted at maritime applications and early warning for fast developing events,\u201d Pedro Sinogas, Tekever\u2019s chief executive, told  SpaceNews . Tekever is leading a consortium of Portuguese companies including solar panel producer Active Space Technologies, propulsion expert Omnidea and the Portuguese division of Spain\u2019s GMV for payload management. Tekever, in emailed responses to  SpaceNews  questions, said the company and its partners have allocated 9 million euros ($10.5 million) for Infante, with some of that coming from Portugal 2020, a research and innovation program of Portugal and the European Commission. The company declined to break out how much is coming from individual sources.  Tekever said Infante will carry multiple payloads, including a multispectral camera, synthetic aperture radar, automatic identification system (AIS) for tracking ships and Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast (ADS-B) for tracking aircraft. The satellite will also have room for science and technology experiments. Tekever hopes to launch the satellite in 2020. The constellation of 12 will carry the same observation and telecom payloads as Infante, but with different payloads on different satellites, the company said.  Infante has a design life of four years. Portuguese and international users have agreed to participate in the demonstration, Tekever said, including the Portuguese Maritime Authority, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Instituto Federal Fluminense in Brazil. The Tekever consortium has yet to pick a launch provider for the satellite, but said three different rockets are currently under consideration. ",

    "content": "After a seven-week holdout, Portugal on Jan. 21 gave its permission to begin development of a multibillion-euro geostationary weather satellite system for Europe, a Eumetsat official said Jan. 25. The Eumetsat meteorological satellite organization\u2019s planned Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) constellation has been held up by a number of issues, including a high-profile dispute between Germany and France over which companies would build the spacecraft. The 26 member nations met in Darmstadt, Germany, Dec. 1, where it was expected that a final agreement to begin construction would be reached.  Portugal was the only nation that would not agree , and Eumetsat bylaws require unanimous consent to begin work on so-called mandatory programs. The nation finally gave its approval Jan. 21, allowing work to begin that month, said Johannes Schmetz, director of Eumetsat\u2019s meteorological division. \u201cThat means MTG can start,\u201d Schmetz said at a meeting of the American Meteorological Society in Seattle. Eumetsat currently operates four geostationary weather satellites, the oldest of which, Meteosat-6, will be de-orbited in the next few months, Schmetz said. The third and fourth satellites in the Meteosat Second Generation fleet are scheduled to launch in 2012 and 2016. Eumetsat has budgeted 2.37 billion euros ($3.25 billion) for the MTG program, while the European Space Agency has committed to cover the remaining 1.26 billion euros. The first of six satellites is planned for launch in 2017 or 2018. In March, Eumetsat chose  Thales Alenia Space  of France, which was partnered with OHB Technology of Germany, to be the MTG prime contractor. Germany had expected Astrium Satellites to be chosen for the lead role, sparking several months of dispute over program leadership. A compromise was reached in June that gave Astrium a greater share of the instrument development work.
